TI  - Spontaneous gain of susceptibility suggests a novel mechanism of resistance to
      hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - e1007400
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007400 [doi]
AB  - Syndromes of hybrid dysgenesis (HD) have been critical for our understanding of
      the transgenerational maintenance of genome stability by piRNA. HD in D. virilis 
      represents a special case of HD since it includes simultaneous mobilization of a 
      set of TEs that belong to different classes. The standard explanation for HD is
      that eggs of the responder strains lack an abundant pool of piRNAs corresponding 
      to the asymmetric TE families transmitted solely by sperm. However, there are
      several strains of D. virilis that lack asymmetric TEs, but exhibit a "neutral"
      cytotype that confers resistance to HD. To characterize the mechanism of
      resistance to HD, we performed a comparative analysis of the landscape of ovarian
      small RNAs in strains that vary in their resistance to HD mediated sterility. We 
      demonstrate that resistance to HD cannot be solely explained by a maternal piRNA 
      pool that matches the assemblage of TEs that likely cause HD. In support of this,
      we have witnessed a cytotype shift from neutral (N) to susceptible (M) in a
      strain devoid of all major TEs implicated in HD. This shift occurred in the
      absence of significant change in TE copy number and expression of piRNAs
      homologous to asymmetric TEs. Instead, this shift is associated with a change in 
      the chromatin profile of repeat sequences unlikely to be causative of paternal
      induction. Overall, our data suggest that resistance to TE-mediated sterility
      during HD may be achieved by mechanisms that are distinct from the canonical
      syndromes of HD.

      Drosophila species.
PG  - 229
LID - 10.1186/s13059-017-1358-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drosophila melanogaster has one of best-described transcriptomes of
      any multicellular organism. Nevertheless, the paucity of 3'-sequencing data in
      this species precludes comprehensive assessment of alternative polyadenylation
      (APA), which is subject to broad tissue-specific control. RESULTS: Here, we
      generate deep 3'-sequencing data from 23 developmental stages, tissues, and cell 
      lines of D. melanogaster, yielding a comprehensive atlas of ~ 62,000
      polyadenylated ends. These data broadly extend the annotated transcriptome,
      identify ~ 40,000 novel 3' termini, and reveal that two-thirds of Drosophila
      genes are subject to APA. Furthermore, we dramatically expand the numbers of
      genes known to be subject to tissue-specific APA, such as 3' untranslated region 
      (UTR) lengthening in head and 3' UTR shortening in testis, and characterize new
      tissue and developmental 3' UTR patterns. Our thorough 3' UTR annotations permit 
      reassessment of post-transcriptional regulatory networks, via conserved miRNA and
      RNA binding protein sites. To evaluate the evolutionary conservation and
      divergence of APA patterns, we generate developmental and tissue-specific 3'-seq 
      libraries from Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila virilis. We document broadly
      analogous tissue-specific APA trends in these species, but also observe
      significant alterations in 3' end usage across orthologs. We exploit the
      population of functionally evolving poly(A) sites to gain clear evidence that
      evolutionary divergence in core polyadenylation signal (PAS) and downstream
      sequence element (DSE) motifs drive broad alterations in 3' UTR isoform
      expression across the Drosophila phylogeny. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a
      critical resource for the Drosophila community and offer many insights into the
      complex control of alternative tissue-specific 3' UTR formation and its
      consequences for post-transcriptional regulatory networks.

TI  - The role of species-specific sensory cues in male responses to mating rivals in
      Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies.
PG  - 9247-9256
LID - 10.1002/ece3.3455 [doi]
AB  - Complex sets of cues can be important in recognizing and responding to
      conspecific mating competitors and avoiding potentially costly heterospecific
      competitive interactions. Within Drosophila melanogaster, males can detect
      sensory inputs from conspecifics to assess the level of competition. They respond
      to rivals by significantly extending mating duration and gain significant fitness
      benefits from doing so. Here, we tested the idea that the multiple sensory cues
      used by D. melanogaster males to detect conspecifics also function to minimize
      "off-target" responses to heterospecific males that they might encounter
      (Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila pseudoobscura, or Drosophila 
      virilis). Focal D. melanogaster males exposed to D. simulans or D. pseudoobscura 
      subsequently increased mating duration, but to a lesser extent than following
      exposure to conspecific rivals. The magnitude of rivals' responses expressed by
      D. melanogaster males did not align with genetic distance between species, and
      none of the sensory manipulations caused D. melanogaster to respond to males of
      all other species tested. However, when we removed or provided "false" sensory
      cues, D. melanogaster males became more likely to show increased mating duration 
      responses to heterospecific males. We suggest that benefits of avoiding
      inaccurate assessment of the competitive environment may shape the evolution of
      recognition cues.

TI  - Comparative analysis of miRNA expression during the development of insects of
      different metamorphosis modes and germ-band types.
PG  - 774
LID - 10.1186/s12864-017-4177-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Do miRNAs contribute to specify the germ-band type and the body
      structure in the insect embryo? Our goal was to address that issue by studying
      the changes in miRNA expression along the ontogeny of the German cockroach
      Blattella germanica, which is a short germ-band and hemimetabolan species.
      RESULTS: We sequenced small RNA libraries representing 11 developmental stages of
      B. germanica ontogeny (with especial emphasis on embryogenesis) and the changes
      in miRNA expression were examined. Data were compared with equivalent data for
      two long germ-band holometabolan species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila
      virilis, and the short germ-band holometabolan species Tribolium castaneum. The
      identification of B. germanica embryo small RNA sequences unveiled miRNAs not
      detected in previous studies, such as those of the MIR-309 family and 54 novel
      miRNAs. Four main waves of miRNA expression were recognized (with most miRNA
      changes occurring during the embryonic stages): the first from day 0 to day 1 of 
      embryogenesis, the second during mid-embryogenesis (days 0-6), the third (with an
      acute expression peak) on day 2 of embryonic development, and the fourth during
      post-embryonic development. The second wave defined the boundaries of
      maternal-to-zygotic transition, with maternal mRNAs being cleared, presumably by 
      Mir-309 and associated scavenger miRNAs. CONCLUSION: miRNAs follow well-defined
      patterns of expression over hemimetabolan ontogeny, patterns that are more
      diverse during embryonic development than during the nymphal stages. The results 
      suggest that miRNAs play important roles in the developmental transitions between
      the embryonic stages of development (starting with maternal loading), during
      which they might influence the germ-band type and metamorphosis mode.

TI  - Role of Fly Cleaning Behavior on Carriage of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas

PG  - 1712-1717
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjx124 [doi]
AB  - Flies are known to be mechanical vectors of bacterial, viral, and parasitic
      diseases. Although flies are known to transmit disease, the effects of cleaning
      behavior have not been well studied. This study quantified the cleaning
      effectiveness and behavior of three fly species: Sarcophaga bullata, Musca
      domestica L., and Drosophila virilis. Flies were transferred to plates of
      Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and allowed to walk on the bacteria
      for a total of 5 min. After the flies were contaminated, they were either
      immediately collected to quantify bacteria or were placed onto sterile plates to 
      clean for 5 or 10 min. After cleaning, flies were placed into tubes with 1 ml of 
      sterile 0.85% saline and were gently shaken for 1 min to remove bacteria. A
      serial dilution was made and 50-microl spot titers were plated. Cleaning behavior
      was also monitored and scored for a period of 5 min. Results demonstrate a
      bacterial reduction for both bacteria on all three fly species. Sarcophaga
      bullata and D. virilis both showed a significant reduction of both bacteria
      within 10 min, whereas M. domestica only showed a significant reduction in P.
      aeruginosa. Cleaning behavior increased significantly in flies that were exposed 
      to bacteria compared to flies that were not exposed to bacteria. This study is
      important, as it demonstrates that fly cleaning could affect mechanical
      transmission of disease, and additional studies should look at flies' abilities
      to remove other types of microorganisms.

TI  - Evolutionary Dynamics of Male Reproductive Genes in the Drosophila virilis
      Subgroup.
PG  - 3145-3155
LID - 10.1534/g3.117.1136 [doi]
AB  - Postcopulatory sexual selection (PCSS) is a potent evolutionary force that can
      drive rapid changes of reproductive genes within species, and thus has the
      potential to generate reproductive incompatibilities between species. Male
      seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are major players in postmating interactions, and
      are important targets of PCSS in males. The virilis subgroup of Drosophila
      exhibits strong interspecific gametic incompatibilities, and can serve as a model
      to study the genetic basis of PCSS and gametic isolation. However, reproductive
      genes in this group have not been characterized. Here we utilize short-read RNA
      sequencing of male reproductive organs to examine the evolutionary dynamics of
      reproductive genes in members of the virilis subgroup: D. americana, D. lummei,
      D. novamexicana, and D. virilis We find that the majority of male reproductive
      transcripts are testes-biased, accounting for approximately 15% of all annotated 
      genes. Ejaculatory bulb (EB)-biased transcripts largely code for lipid metabolic 
      enzymes, and contain orthologs of the D. melanogaster EB protein, Peb-me, which
      is involved in mating-plug formation. In addition, we identify 71 candidate SFPs,
      and show that this gene set has the highest rate of nonsynonymous codon
      substitution relative to testes- and EB-biased genes. Furthermore, we identify
      orthologs of 35 D. melanogaster SFPs that have conserved accessory gland
      expression in the virilis group. Finally, we show that several of the SFPs that
      have the highest rate of nonsynonymous codon substitution reside on chromosomal
      regions, which contributes to paternal gametic incompatibility between species.
      Our results show that SFPs rapidly diversify in the virilis group, and suggest
      that they likely play a role in PCSS and/or gametic isolation.

TI  - Plant carnivory beyond bogs: reliance on prey feeding in Drosophyllum lusitanicum
      (Drosophyllaceae) in dry Mediterranean heathland habitats.
PG  - 1035-1041
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcw247 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: In a cost-benefit framework, plant carnivory is hypothesized
      to be an adaptation to nutrient-poor soils in sunny, wetland habitats. However,
      apparent exceptions to this cost-benefit model exist, although they have been
      rarely studied. One of these exceptions is the carnivorous subshrub Drosophyllum 
      lusitanicum , which thrives in Mediterranean heathlands on dry sandstone soils
      and has relatively well-developed, xeromorphic roots. Here, the roles of leaf
      (carnivory) and root (soil) nutrient uptake in growth promotion of this
      particular species were assessed. Methods: In a greenhouse experiment, plants
      were fed with laboratory-reared fruit flies ( Drosophila virilis ) and received
      two concentrations of soil nutrients in a factorial design. Above-ground plant
      growth and final above- and below-ground dry biomass after 13 weeks were
      recorded. Nutrient uptake via roots was also evaluated, using stable nitrogen
      isotope analysis. Key Results: Insect feeding resulted in significantly higher
      growth and above- and below-ground biomass compared with soil fertilization. No
      additional benefits of fertilization were discernable when plants were
      insect-fed, indicating that roots were not efficient in nutrient absorption.
      Conclusions: The first evidence of strong reliance on insect prey feeding in a
      dry-soil carnivorous plant with well-developed roots is provided, suggesting that
      carnivory per se does not preclude persistence in dry habitats. Instead, the
      combination of carnivory and xeromorphic root features allows Drosophyllum to
      thrive on non-waterlogged soils. New evidence is added to recent research
      emphasizing the role of root systems of carnivorous plants in explaining their
      distribution, partly challenging the cost-benefit hypothesis.

TI  - Inducing Cold-Sensitivity in the Frigophilic Fly Drosophila montana by RNAi.
PG  - e0165724
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0165724 [doi]
AB  - Cold acclimation is a critical physiological adaptation for coping with seasonal 
      cold. By increasing their cold tolerance individuals can remain active for longer
      at the onset of winter and can recover more quickly from a cold shock. In
      insects, despite many physiological studies, little is known about the genetic
      basis of cold acclimation. Recently, transcriptomic analyses in Drosophila
      virilis and D. montana revealed candidate genes for cold acclimation by
      identifying genes upregulated during exposure to cold. Here, we test the role of 
      myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (Inos), in cold tolerance in D. montana using
      an RNAi approach. D. montana has a circumpolar distribution and overwinters as an
      adult in northern latitudes with extreme cold. We assessed cold tolerance of
      dsRNA knock-down flies using two metrics: chill-coma recovery time (CCRT) and
      mortality rate after cold acclimation. Injection of dsRNAInos did not alter CCRT,
      either overall or in interaction with the cold treatment, however it did induced 
      cold-specific mortality, with high levels of mortality observed in injected flies
      acclimated at 5 degrees C but not at 19 degrees C. Overall, injection with
      dsRNAInos induced a temperature-sensitive mortality rate of over 60% in this
      normally cold-tolerant species. qPCR analysis confirmed that dsRNA injection
      successfully reduced gene expression of Inos. Thus, our results demonstrate the
      involvement of Inos in increasing cold tolerance in D. montana. The potential
      mechanisms involved by which Inos increases cold tolerance are also discussed.

TI  - Multiple Genes Cause Postmating Prezygotic Reproductive Isolation in the
      Drosophila virilis Group.
PG  - 4067-4076
LID - 10.1534/g3.116.033340 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of speciation is a central problem in
      evolutionary biology. Studies of reproductive isolation have provided several
      insights into the genetic causes of speciation, especially in taxa that lend
      themselves to detailed genetic scrutiny. Reproductive barriers have usually been 
      divided into those that occur before zygote formation (prezygotic) and after
      (postzygotic), with the latter receiving a great deal of attention over several
      decades. Reproductive barriers that occur after mating but before zygote
      formation [postmating prezygotic (PMPZ)] are especially understudied at the
      genetic level. Here, I present a phenotypic and genetic analysis of a PMPZ
      reproductive barrier between two species of the Drosophila virilis group: D.
      americana and D. virilis This species pair shows strong PMPZ isolation,
      especially when D. americana males mate with D. virilis females: approximately
      99% of eggs laid after these heterospecific copulations are not fertilized.
      Previous work has shown that the paternal loci contributing to this
      incompatibility reside on two chromosomes, one of which (chromosome 5) likely
      carries multiple factors. The other (chromosome 2) is fixed for a paracentric
      inversion that encompasses nearly half the chromosome. Here, I present two
      results. First, I show that PMPZ in this species cross is largely due to
      defective sperm storage in heterospecific copulations. Second, using advanced
      intercross and backcross mapping approaches, I identify genomic regions that
      carry genes capable of rescuing heterospecific fertilization. I conclude that
      paternal incompatibility between D. americana males and D. virilis females is
      underlain by four or more genes on chromosomes 2 and 5.

TI  - Potential steps in the evolution of a fused trimeric all-beta dUTPase involve a
      catalytically competent fused dimeric intermediate.
PG  - 3268-86
LID - 10.1111/febs.13800 [doi]
AB  - Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) is essential for
      genome integrity. Interestingly, this enzyme from Drosophila virilis has an
      unusual form, as three monomer repeats are merged with short linker sequences,
      yielding a fused trimer-like dUTPase fold. Unlike homotrimeric dUTPases that are 
      encoded by a single repeat dut gene copy, the three repeats of the D. virilis dut
      gene are not identical due to several point mutations. We investigated the
      potential evolutionary pathway that led to the emergence of this extant fused
      trimeric dUTPase in D. virilis. The herein proposed scenario involves two
      sequential gene duplications followed by sequence divergence amongst the dut
      repeats. This pathway thus requires the existence of a transient
      two-repeat-containing fused dimeric dUTPase intermediate. We identified the
      corresponding ancestral dUTPase single repeat enzyme together with its tandem
      repeat evolutionary intermediate and characterized their enzymatic function and
      structural stability. We additionally engineered and characterized artificial
      single or tandem repeat constructs from the extant enzyme form to investigate the
      influence of the emergent residue alterations on the formation of a functional
      assembly. The observed severely impaired stability and catalytic activity of
      these latter constructs provide a plausible explanation for evolutionary
      persistence of the extant fused trimeric D. virilis dUTPase form. For the
      ancestral homotrimeric and the fused dimeric intermediate forms, we observed
      strong catalytic and structural competence, verifying viability of the proposed
      evolutionary pathway. We conclude that the progression along the herein described
      evolutionary trajectory is determined by the retained potential of the enzyme for
      its conserved three-fold structural symmetry.

TI  - A single amino-acid substitution toggles chloride dependence of the alpha-amylase
      paralog amyrel in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis species.
PG  - 70-7

AB  - In animals, most alpha-amylases are chloride-dependent enzymes. A chloride ion is
      required for allosteric activation and is coordinated by one asparagine and two
      arginine side chains. Whereas the asparagine and one arginine are strictly
      conserved, the main chloride binding arginine is replaced by a glutamine in some 
      rare instances, resulting in the loss of chloride binding and activation. Amyrel 
      is a distant paralogue of alpha-amylase in Diptera, which was not characterized
      biochemically to date. Amyrel shows both substitutions depending on the species. 
      In Drosophila melanogaster, an arginine is present in the sequence but in
      Drosophila virilis, a glutamine occurs at this position. We have investigated
      basic enzymological parameters and the dependence to chloride of Amyrel of both
      species, produced in yeast, and in mutants substituting arginine to glutamine or 
      glutamine to arginine. We found that the amylolytic activity of Amyrel is about
      thirty times weaker than the classical Drosophila alpha-amylase, and that the
      substitution of the arginine by a glutamine in D. melanogaster suppressed the
      chloride-dependence but was detrimental to activity. In contrast, changing the
      glutamine into an arginine rendered D. virilis Amyrel chloride-dependent, and
      interestingly, significantly increased its catalytic efficiency. These results
      show that the chloride ion is not mandatory for Amyrel but stimulates the

PG  - 580-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3233 [doi]
AB  - Proper gene expression requires coordinated interplay among transcriptional
      coactivators, transcription factors and the general transcription machinery. We
      report here that MSL1, a central component of the dosage compensation complex in 
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis, displays evolutionarily conserved
      sex-independent binding to promoters. Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal a
      functional interaction of MSL1 with CDK7, a subunit of the Cdk-activating kinase 
      (CAK) complex of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Importantly, MSL1
      depletion leads to decreased phosphorylation of Ser5 of RNA polymerase II. In
      addition, we demonstrate that MSL1 is a phosphoprotein, and transgenic flies
      expressing MSL1 phosphomutants show mislocalization of the histone
      acetyltransferase MOF and histone H4 K16 acetylation, thus ultimately causing
      male lethality due to a failure of dosage compensation. We propose that, by
      virtue of its interaction with components of the general transcription machinery,
      MSL1 exists in different phosphorylation states, thereby modulating transcription
      in flies.

TI  - Two phases of aging separated by the Smurf transition as a public path to death.
PG  - 23523
LID - 10.1038/srep23523 [doi]
AB  - Aging's most obvious characteristic is the time dependent increase of an
      individual's probability to die. This lifelong process is accompanied by a large 
      number of molecular and physiological changes. Although numerous genes involved
      in aging have been identified in the past decades its leading factors have yet to
      be determined. To identify the very processes driving aging we have developed in 
      the past years an assay to identify physiologically old individuals in a
      synchronized population of Drosophila melanogaster. Those individuals show an
      age-dependent increase of intestinal permeability followed by a high risk of
      death. Here we show that this physiological marker of aging is conserved in 3
      invertebrate species Drosophila mojavensis, Drosophila virilis, Caenorhabditis
      elegans as well as in 1 vertebrate species Danio rerio. Our findings suggest that
      intestinal barrier dysfunction may be an important event in the aging process
      conserved across a broad range of species, thus raising the possibility that it
      may also be the case in Homo sapiens.

TI  - Helitrons shaping the genomic architecture of Drosophila: enrichment of DINE-TR1 
      in alpha- and beta-heterochromatin, satellite DNA emergence, and piRNA
      expression.
PG  - 597-613
LID - 10.1007/s10577-015-9480-x [doi]
AB  - Drosophila INterspersed Elements (DINEs) constitute an abundant but poorly
      understood group of Helitrons present in several Drosophila species. The general 
      structure of DINEs includes two conserved blocks that may or not contain a region
      with tandem repeats in between. These central tandem repeats (CTRs) are similar
      within species but highly divergent between species. It has been assumed that
      CTRs have independent origins. Herein, we identify a subset of DINEs, termed
      DINE-TR1, which contain homologous CTRs of approximately 150 bp. We found
      DINE-TR1 in the sequenced genomes of several Drosophila species and in Bactrocera
      tryoni (Acalyptratae, Diptera). However, interspecific high sequence identity (
      approximately 88 %) is limited to the first approximately 30 bp of each tandem
      repeat, implying that evolutionary constraints operate differently over the
      monomer length. DINE-TR1 is unevenly distributed across the Drosophila phylogeny.
      Nevertheless, sequence analysis suggests vertical transmission. We found that
      CTRs within DINE-TR1 have independently expanded into satellite DNA-like arrays
      at least twice within Drosophila. By analyzing the genome of Drosophila virilis
      and Drosophila americana, we show that DINE-TR1 is highly abundant in
      pericentromeric heterochromatin boundaries, some telomeric regions and in the Y
      chromosome. It is also present in the centromeric region of one autosome from D. 
      virilis and dispersed throughout several euchromatic sites in both species. We
      further found that DINE-TR1 is abundant at piRNA clusters, and small
      DINE-TR1-derived RNA transcripts ( approximately 25 nt) are predominantly
      expressed in the testes and the ovaries, suggesting active targeting by the piRNA
      machinery. These features suggest potential piRNA-mediated regulatory roles for
      DINEs at local and genome-wide scales in Drosophila.

TI  - Seasonal gene expression kinetics between diapause phases in Drosophila virilis
      group species and overwintering differences between diapausing and non-diapausing
      females.
PG  - 11197
LID - 10.1038/srep11197 [doi]
AB  - Most northern insect species experience a period of developmental arrest,
      diapause, which enables them to survive over the winter and postpone reproduction
      until favorable conditions. We studied the timing of reproductive diapause and
      its long-term effects on the cold tolerance of Drosophila montana, D. littoralis 
      and D. ezoana females in seasonally varying environmental conditions. At the same
      time we traced expression levels of 219 genes in D. montana using a custom-made
      microarray. We show that the seasonal switch to reproductive diapause occurs over
      a short time period, and that overwintering in reproductive diapause has
      long-lasting effects on cold tolerance. Some genes, such as Hsc70, Jon25Bi and
      period, were upregulated throughout the diapause, while others, including
      regucalcin, couch potato and Thor, were upregulated only at its specific phases. 
      Some of the expression patterns induced during the sensitive stage, when the
      females either enter diapause or not, remained induced regardless of the later
      conditions. qPCR analyses confirmed the findings of the microarray analysis in D.
      montana and revealed similar gene expression changes in D. littoralis and D.
      ezoana. The present study helps to achieve a better understanding of the genetic 
      regulation of diapause and of the plasticity of seasonal responses in general.

TI  - Acoustic duetting in Drosophila virilis relies on the integration of auditory and
      tactile signals.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.07277 [doi]
AB  - Many animal species, including insects, are capable of acoustic duetting, a
      complex social behavior in which males and females tightly control the rate and
      timing of their courtship song syllables relative to each other. The mechanisms
      underlying duetting remain largely unknown across model systems. Most studies of 
      duetting focus exclusively on acoustic interactions, but the use of multisensory 
      cues should aid in coordinating behavior between individuals. To test this
      hypothesis, we develop Drosophila virilis as a new model for studies of duetting.
      By combining sensory manipulations, quantitative behavioral assays, and
      statistical modeling, we show that virilis females combine precisely timed
      auditory and tactile cues to drive song production and duetting. Tactile cues
      delivered to the abdomen and genitalia play the larger role in females, as even
      headless females continue to coordinate song production with courting males.
      These data, therefore, reveal a novel, non-acoustic, mechanism for acoustic
      duetting. Finally, our results indicate that female-duetting circuits are not
      sexually differentiated, as males can also produce 'female-like' duets in a
      context-dependent manner.

      Wing.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0124824 [doi]
AB  - The aerodynamic features of a bio-realistic 3D fruit fly wing in steady state
      (snapshot) flight conditions were analyzed numerically. The wing geometry was
      created from high resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of the fruit
      fly Drosophila virilis. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses of the wing
      were conducted at ultra-low Reynolds numbers ranging from 71 to 200, and at
      angles of attack ranging from -10 degrees to +30 degrees . It was found that in
      the 3D bio-realistic model, the corrugations of the wing created localized
      circulation regions in the flow field, most notably at higher angles of attack
      near the wing tip. Analyses of a simplified flat wing geometry showed higher lift
      to drag performance values for any given angle of attack at these Reynolds
      numbers, though very similar performance is noted at -10 degrees . Results have
      indicated that the simplified flat wing can successfully be used to approximate
      high-level properties such as aerodynamic coefficients and overall performance
      trends as well as large flow-field structures. However, local pressure peaks and 
      near-wing flow features induced by the corrugations are unable to be replicated
      by the simple wing. We therefore recommend that accurate 3D bio-realistic
      geometries be used when modelling insect wings where such information is useful.

TI  - A single gene causes an interspecific difference in pigmentation in Drosophila.
PG  - 331-42
LID - 10.1534/genetics.115.174920 [doi]
AB  - The genetic basis of species differences remains understudied. Studies in insects
      have contributed significantly to our understanding of morphological evolution.
      Pigmentation traits in particular have received a great deal of attention and
      several genes in the insect pigmentation pathway have been implicated in inter-
      and intraspecific differences. Nonetheless, much remains unknown about many of
      the genes in this pathway and their potential role in understudied taxa. Here we 
      genetically analyze the puparium color difference between members of the virilis 
      group of Drosophila. The puparium of Drosophila virilis is black, while those of 
      D. americana, D. novamexicana, and D. lummei are brown. We used a series of
      backcross hybrid populations between D. americana and D. virilis to map the
      genomic interval responsible for the difference between this species pair. First,
      we show that the pupal case color difference is caused by a single Mendelizing
      factor, which we ultimately map to an approximately 11-kb region on chromosome 5.
      The mapped interval includes only the first exon and regulatory region(s) of the 
      dopamine N-acetyltransferase gene (Dat). This gene encodes an enzyme that is
      known to play a part in the insect pigmentation pathway. Second, we show that
      this gene is highly expressed at the onset of pupation in light brown taxa (D.
      americana and D. novamexicana) relative to D. virilis, but not in the dark brown 
      D. lummei. Finally, we examine the role of Dat in adult pigmentation between D.
      americana (heavily melanized) and D. novamexicana (lightly melanized) and find no
      discernible effect of this gene in adults. Our results demonstrate that a single 
      gene is entirely or almost entirely responsible for a morphological difference
      between species.

TI  - [Species-specific localization of DNA from pericentromeric heterochromatin on
      polytene chromosomes in the salivary gland cells and 3D-nuclear organization
      nurse cells in Drosophila virilis, and Drosophila kanekoi (Diptera:
      Drosophilidae)].
PG  - 1299-304
AB  - Microdissection of the chromocenter of D. virilis salivary gland polytene
      chromosomes has been carried out and the region-specific. DNA library (DvirIII)
      has been obtained. FISH was used for DvirIII hybridization with salivary gland
      polytene chromosomes and ovarian nurse cells of D. virilis and D. kanekoi.
      Localization of DvirIII in the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes and in the 
      telomeric region of chromosome 5 was observed in both species. Moreover, species 
      specificity in the localization of DNA sequences of DvirIII in some chromosomal
      regions was detected. In order to study the three-dimensional organization of
      pericentromeric heterochromatin region of polytene chromosomes of ovarian nurse
      cells of D. virilis and D. kanekoi, 3D FISH DvirIII was performed with nurse
      cells of these species. As a result, species specificity in the distribution of
      DvirIII signals in the nuclear space was revealed. Namely, the signal was
      detected in the local chromocenter at one pole of the nucleus in D. virilis,
      while the signal from the telomeric region of chromosome 5 was detected on
      another pole. At the same time, DvirIII signals in D. kanekoi are localized in
      two separate areas in the nucleus: the first belongs to the pericentromeric
      region of chromosome 2 and another to pericentromeric regions of the remaining
      chromosomes.

TI  - Specific features in linear and spatial organizations of pericentromeric
      heterochromatin regions in polytene chromosomes of the closely related species
      Drosophila virilis and D. kanekoi (Diptera: Drosophilidae).
PG  - 331-42
LID - 10.1007/s10709-015-9832-7 [doi]
AB  - Heterochromatin plays an important role in the spatial arrangement and evolution 
      of the eukaryotic genetic apparatus. The closely related species Drosophila
      virilis (phyla virilis) and D. kanekoi (phyla montana) differ in the amount of
      heterochromatin along the chromosomes as well as by the presence of the
      metacentric chromosome 2, which emerged as a result of a pericentric inversion
      during speciation, in the D. kanekoi karyotype. The purpose of this study was to 
      establish if chromosome rearrangements have any influence on the linear
      redistribution of centromeric heterochromatin in polytene chromosomes and the
      spatial organization of chromosomes in the nuclei of nurse cell. We have
      microdissected the chromocenter of D. virilis salivary gland polytene
      chromosomes; obtained a DNA library of this region (DvirIII); and hybridized
      (FISH) DvirIII to the salivary gland and nurse cell polytene chromosomes of D.
      virilis and D. kanekoi. We demonstrated that DvirIII localizes to the
      pericentromeric heterochromatin regions of all chromosomes and peritelomeric
      region of chromosome 5 in both species. Unlike D. virilis, the DvirIII signal in 
      D. kanekoi chromosomes is detectable in the telomeric region of chromosome 2. We 
      have also conducted a 3D FISH of DvirIII probe to the D. virilis and D. kanekoi
      nurse cell chromosomes. In particular, the DvirIII signal in D. virilis was
      observed in the local chromocenter at one pole of the nucleus, while the signal
      belonging to the telomeric region of chromosome 5 was detectable at the other
      pole. In contrast, in D. kanekoi there exist two separate DvirIII-positive
      regions. One of these regions belongs to the pericentromeric region of chromosome
      2 and the other, to pericentromeric regions of the remaining chromosomes. These
      results suggest that chromosome rearrangements play an important role in the
      redistribution of heterochromatin DNA sequences in the genome, representing a
      speciation mechanism, which, in general, could also affect the chromosome
      orientation in the 3D nuclear space.

TI  - How consistent are the transcriptome changes associated with cold acclimation in 
      two species of the Drosophila virilis group?
PG  - 13-21
LID - 10.1038/hdy.2015.6 [doi]
AB  - For many organisms the ability to cold acclimate with the onset of seasonal cold 
      has major implications for their fitness. In insects, where this ability is
      widespread, the physiological changes associated with increased cold tolerance
      have been well studied. Despite this, little work has been done to trace changes 
      in gene expression during cold acclimation that lead to an increase in cold
      tolerance. We used an RNA-Seq approach to investigate this in two species of the 
      Drosophila virilis group. We found that the majority of genes that are
      differentially expressed during cold acclimation differ between the two species. 
      Despite this, the biological processes associated with the differentially
      expressed genes were broadly similar in the two species. These included:
      metabolism, cell membrane composition, and circadian rhythms, which are largely
      consistent with previous work on cold acclimation/cold tolerance. In addition, we
      also found evidence of the involvement of the rhodopsin pathway in cold
      acclimation, a pathway that has been recently linked to thermotaxis.
      Interestingly, we found no evidence of differential expression of stress genes
      implying that long-term cold acclimation and short-term stress response may have 
      a different physiological basis.

      controlled by maternally deposited products, and it is not until later stages
      that widespread activation of the zygotic genome occurs. Although the mechanisms 
      driving this genome activation are currently unknown, the transcriptional
      activator Zelda (ZLD) has been shown to be instrumental in driving this process
      in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we define functional domains of ZLD required for
      both DNA binding and transcriptional activation. We show that the C-terminal
      cluster of four zinc fingers mediates binding to TAGteam DNA elements in the
      promoters of early expressed genes. All four zinc fingers are required for this
      activity, and splice isoforms lacking three of the four zinc fingers fail to
      activate transcription. These truncated splice isoforms dominantly suppress
      activation by the full-length, embryonically expressed isoform. We map the
      transcriptional activation domain of ZLD to a central region characterized by low
      complexity. Despite relatively little sequence conservation within this domain,
      ZLD orthologs from Drosophila virilis, Anopheles gambiae, and Nasonia vitripennis
      activate transcription in D. melanogaster cells. Transcriptional activation by
      these ZLD orthologs suggests that ZLD functions through conserved interactions
      with a protein cofactor(s). We have identified distinct DNA-binding and
      activation domains within the critical transcription factor ZLD that controls the
      initial activation of the zygotic genome.

TI  - NLS copy-number variation governs efficiency of nuclear import--case study on
      dUTPases.
PG  - 5463-78
LID - 10.1111/febs.13086 [doi]
AB  - Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of large macromolecules requires an active
      transport machinery. In many cases, this is initiated by binding of the nuclear
      localization signal (NLS) peptide of cargo proteins to importin-alpha molecules. 
      Fine orchestration of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is of particularly high
      importance for proteins involved in maintenance of genome integrity, such as
      dUTPases, which are responsible for prevention of uracil incorporation into the
      genome. In most eukaryotes, dUTPases have two homotrimeric isoforms: one of these
      contains three NLSs and is present in the cell nucleus, while the other is
      located in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria. Here we focus on the unusual
      occurrence of a pseudo-heterotrimeric dUTPase in Drosophila virilis that contains
      one NLS, and investigate its localization pattern compared to the homotrimeric
      dUTPase isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster. Although the interaction of
      individual NLSs with importin-alpha has been well characterized, the question of 
      how multiple NLSs of oligomeric cargo proteins affect their trafficking has been 
      less frequently addressed in adequate detail. Using the D. virilis dUTPase as a
      fully relevant physiologically occurring model protein, we show that NLS copy
      number influences the efficiency of nuclear import in both insect and mammalian
      cell lines, as well as in D. melanogaster and D. virilis tissues. Biophysical
      data indicate that NLS copy number determines the stoichiometry of complexation
      between importin-alpha and dUTPases. The main conclusion of our study is that, in
      D. virilis, a single dUTPase isoform efficiently reproduces the cellular dUTPase 
      distribution pattern that requires two isoforms in D. melanogaster.

AB  - Piwi-interacting (pi)RNAs repress diverse transposable elements in germ cells of 
      Metazoa and are essential for fertility in both invertebrates and vertebrates.
      The precursors of piRNAs are transcribed from distinct genomic regions, the
      so-called piRNA clusters; however, how piRNA clusters are differentiated from the
      rest of the genome is not known. To address this question, we studied piRNA
      biogenesis in two D. virilis strains that show differential ability to generate
      piRNAs from several genomic regions. We found that active piRNA biogenesis
      correlates with high levels of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) over
      genomic regions that give rise to piRNAs. Furthermore, piRNA biogenesis in the
      progeny requires the transgenerational inheritance of an epigenetic signal,
      presumably in the form of homologous piRNAs that are generated in the maternal
      germline and deposited into the oocyte. The inherited piRNAs enhance piRNA
      biogenesis through the installment of H3K9me3 on piRNA clusters.

TI  - Tetris is a foldback transposon that provided the building blocks for an emerging
      satellite DNA of Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 1302-13
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evu108 [doi]
AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) and satellite DNAs (satDNAs) are abundant components 
      of most eukaryotic genomes studied so far and their impact on evolution has been 
      the focus of several studies. A number of studies linked TEs with satDNAs, but
      the nature of their evolutionary relationships remains unclear. During in silico 
      analyses of the Drosophila virilis assembled genome, we found a novel DNA
      transposon we named Tetris based on its modular structure and diversity of
      rearranged forms. We aimed to characterize Tetris and investigate its role in
      generating satDNAs. Data mining and sequence analysis showed that Tetris is
      apparently nonautonomous, with a structure similar to foldback elements, and
      present in D. virilis and D. americana. Herein, we show that Tetris shares the
      final portions of its terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) with DAIBAM, a previously 
      described miniature inverted transposable element implicated in the generation of
      chromosome inversions. Both elements are likely to be mobilized by the same
      autonomous TE. Tetris TIRs contain approximately 220-bp internal tandem repeats
      that we have named TIR-220. We also found TIR-220 repeats making up longer
      (kb-size) satDNA-like arrays. Using bioinformatic, phylogenetic and cytogenomic
      tools, we demonstrated that Tetris has contributed to shaping the genomes of D.
      virilis and D. americana, providing internal tandem repeats that served as
      building blocks for the amplification of satDNA arrays. The beta-heterochromatic 
      genomic environment seemed to have favored such amplification. Our results imply 
      for the first time a role for foldback elements in generating satDNAs.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0091924 [doi]
AB  - Changes in regulatory DNA contribute to phenotypic differences within and between
      taxa. Comparative studies show that many transcription factor binding sites
      (TFBS) are conserved between species whereas functional studies reveal that some 
      mutations segregating within species alter TFBS function. Consistently, in this
      analysis of 13 regulatory elements in Drosophila melanogaster populations, single
      base and insertion/deletion polymorphism are rare in characterized regulatory
      elements. Experimentally defined TFBS are nearly devoid of segregating mutations 
      and, as has been shown before, are quite conserved. For instance 8 of 11
      Hunchback binding sites in the stripe 3+7 enhancer of even-skipped are conserved 
      between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. Oddly, we found a 72 bp deletion 
      that removes one of these binding sites (Hb8), segregating within D.
      melanogaster. Furthermore, a 45 bp deletion polymorphism in the spacer between
      the stripe 3+7 and stripe 2 enhancers, removes another predicted Hunchback site. 
      These two deletions are separated by approximately 250 bp, sit on distinct
      haplotypes, and segregate at appreciable frequency. The Hb8Delta is at 5 to 35%
      frequency in the new world, but also shows cosmopolitan distribution. There is
      depletion of sequence variation on the Hb8Delta-carrying haplotype. Quantitative 
      genetic tests indicate that Hb8Delta affects developmental time, but not
      viability of offspring. The Eve expression pattern differs between inbred lines, 
      but the stripe 3 and 7 boundaries seem unaffected by Hb8Delta. The data reveal
      segregating variation in regulatory elements, which may reflect evolutionary
      turnover of characterized TFBS due to drift or co-evolution.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing in Drosophila virilis identifies Polyphemus, a recently
      activated Tc1-like transposon with a possible role in hybrid dysgenesis.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1759-8753-5-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hybrid dysgenic syndromes in Drosophila have been critical for
      characterizing host mechanisms of transposable element (TE) regulation. This is
      because a common feature of hybrid dysgenesis is germline TE mobilization that
      occurs when paternally inherited TEs are not matched with a maternal pool of
      silencing RNAs that maintain transgenerational TE control. In the face of this
      imbalance TEs become activated in the germline and can cause F1 sterility. The
      syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis was the first to show that
      the mobilization of one dominant TE, the Penelope retrotransposon, may lead to
      the mobilization of other unrelated elements. However, it is not known how many
      different elements contribute and no exhaustive search has been performed to
      identify additional ones. To identify additional TEs that may contribute to
      hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis, I analyzed repeat content in genome
      sequences of inducer and non-inducer lines. RESULTS: Here I describe Polyphemus, 
      a novel Tc1-like DNA transposon, which is abundant in the inducer strain of D.
      virilis but highly degraded in the non-inducer strain. Polyphemus expression is
      also increased in the germline of progeny of the dysgenic cross relative to
      reciprocal progeny. Interestingly, like the Penelope element, it has experienced 
      recent re-activation within the D. virilis lineage. CONCLUSIONS: Here I present
      the results of a comprehensive search to identify additional factors that may
      cause hybrid dysgenesis in D. virilis. Polyphemus, a novel Tc1-like DNA
      transposon, has recently become re-activated in Drosophila virilis and likely
      contributes to the hybrid dysgenesis syndrome. It has been previously shown that 
      the Penelope element has also been re-activated in the inducer strain. This
      suggests that TE co-reactivation within species may synergistically contribute to

AB  - The variability of the chromosomal fragments of the atp6 mitochondrial gene,
      which is integrated into chromosomal DNA in the lines of flies of different
      geographic origins and in the passaged cell lines of D. virilis has been
      analyzed. We did not reveal any nucleotide variability in this DNA marker among
      the studied fly lines. This result is consistent with the proposition that the D.
      virilis species is monomorphic. The new fragments of the atp6 gene that are
      associated with the insertions of the Tv1 retrotransposon and are absent in the
      fly genome are revealed in the genome of the passaged cell line of D. virilis.
      This fact is evidence of the activation of the mitochondrial DNA transfer into
      the nuclear genome of the cells of passaged cell culture.

AB  - MicroRNAs are short non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the 
      post-transcriptional level and are essential for the embryonic development of
      multicellular animals. Comparative genome-scale analyses have revealed that
      metazoan evolution is accompanied by the continuous acquisition of novel microRNA
      genes. This suggests that novel microRNAs may promote innovation and diversity in
      development. We determined the evolutionary origins of extant Drosophila
      microRNAs and estimated the sequence divergence between the 130 orthologous
      microRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis, separated by 63
      million years of evolution. We then generated small RNA sequencing data sets
      covering D. virilis development and explored the relationship between microRNA
      conservation and expression in a developmental context. We find that late
      embryonic, larval, and adult stages are dominated by conserved microRNAs. This
      pattern, however, does not hold for the early embryo, where rapidly evolving
      microRNAs are uniquely present at high levels in both species. The group of
      fast-evolving microRNAs that are highly expressed in the early embryo belong to
      two Drosophilid lineage-specific clusters: mir-310 approximately 313 and mir-309 
      approximately 6. These clusters have particularly complex evolutionary histories 
      of duplication, gain, and loss. Our analyses suggest that the early embryo is a
      more permissive environment for microRNA changes and innovations. Fast-evolving
      microRNAs, therefore, have the opportunity to become preferentially integrated in
      early developmental processes, and may impact the evolution of development. The
      relationship between microRNA conservation and expression throughout the
      development of Drosophila differs from that previously observed for
      protein-coding genes.

      Cyp6g1 locus contribute to resistance to multiple insecticides in Drosophila.
PG  - e84879
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0084879 [doi]
AB  - Widespread use of insecticides has led to insecticide resistance in many
      populations of insects. In some populations, resistance has evolved to multiple
      pesticides. In Drosophila melanogaster, resistance to multiple classes of
      insecticide is due to the overexpression of a single cytochrome P450 gene,
      Cyp6g1. Overexpression of Cyp6g1 appears to have evolved in parallel in
      Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster, where it is also
      associated with insecticide resistance. However, it is not known whether the
      ability of the CYP6G1 enzyme to provide resistance to multiple insecticides
      evolved recently in D. melanogaster or if this function is present in all
      Drosophila species. Here we show that duplication of the Cyp6g1 gene occurred at 
      least four times during the evolution of different Drosophila species, and the
      ability of CYP6G1 to confer resistance to multiple insecticides exists in D.
      melanogaster and D. simulans but not in Drosophila willistoni or Drosophila
      virilis. In D. virilis, which has multiple copies of Cyp6g1, one copy confers
      resistance to DDT and another to nitenpyram, suggesting that the divergence of
      protein sequence between copies subsequent to the duplication affected the
      activity of the enzyme. All orthologs tested conferred resistance to one or more 
      insecticides, suggesting that CYP6G1 had the capacity to provide resistance to
      anthropogenic chemicals before they existed. Finally, we show that expression of 
      Cyp6g1 in the Malpighian tubules, which contributes to DDT resistance in D.
      melanogaster, is specific to the D. melanogaster-D. simulans lineage. Our results
      suggest that a combination of gene duplication, regulatory changes and protein
      coding changes has taken place at the Cyp6g1 locus during evolution and this
      locus may play a role in providing resistance to different environmental toxins
      in different Drosophila species.

TI  - Patterns of molecular evolution of the germ line specification gene oskar suggest
      that a novel domain may contribute to functional divergence in Drosophila.
PG  - 65-77
LID - 10.1007/s00427-013-0463-7 [doi]
AB  - In several metazoans including flies of the genus Drosophila, germ line
      specification occurs through the inheritance of maternally deposited cytoplasmic 
      determinants, collectively called germ plasm. The novel insect gene oskar is at
      the top of the Drosophila germ line specification pathway, and also plays an
      important role in posterior patterning. A novel N-terminal domain of oskar (the
      Long Oskar domain) evolved in Drosophilids, but the role of this domain in oskar 
      functional evolution is unknown. Trans-species transgenesis experiments have
      shown that oskar orthologs from different Drosophila species have functionally
      diverged, but the underlying selective pressures and molecular changes have not
      been investigated. As a first step toward understanding how Oskar function could 
      have evolved, we applied molecular evolution analysis to oskar sequences from the
      completely sequenced genomes of 16 Drosophila species from the Sophophora
      subgenus, Drosophila virilis and Drosophila immigrans. We show that overall, this
      gene is subject to purifying selection, but that individual predicted structural 
      and functional domains are subject to heterogeneous selection pressures.
      Specifically, two domains, the Drosophila-specific Long Osk domain and the region
      that interacts with the germ plasm protein Lasp, are evolving at a faster rate
      than other regions of oskar. Further, we provide evidence that positive selection
      may have acted on specific sites within these two domains on the D. virilis
      branch. Our domain-based analysis suggests that changes in the Long Osk and
      Lasp-binding domains are strong candidates for the molecular basis of functional 
      divergence between the Oskar proteins of D. melanogaster and D. virilis. This
      molecular evolutionary analysis thus represents an important step towards
      understanding the role of an evolutionarily and developmentally critical gene in 
      germ plasm evolution and assembly.

LID - 10.1387/ijdb.120189me [doi]
AB  - Hybrid dysgenesis (HD) syndrome in Drosophila virilis presumably results from the
      mobilization of several unrelated mobile genetic elements in dysgenic hybrids.
      Morphogenetic events during oogenesis and spermatogenesis were investigated in
      detail in the progeny of D. virilis dysgenic crosses. Using germ-cell specific
      anti-Vasa staining, we monitored the fate of germline cells at different
      ontogenetic stages in strains of D. virilis and their hybrids. Anti-Vasa staining
      indicated that the major loss of pole cells occurs in dysgenic embryos at stage
      11-14 after primordial germ cells (PGC) pass the midgut wall. At later
      ontogenetic stages, including larvae, pupae and imagoes, we often observed an
      abnormal development of gonads in dysgenic individuals with a frequent occurrence
      of unilateral and bilateral gonadal atrophy. Dysgenic females were characterized 
      by the presence of various sterile ovarian phenotypes that predominantly include 
      agametic ovarioles, while other atypical forms such as tumor-like ovarioles and
      dorsalized ovariolar follicles may also be present. Testis abnormalities were
      also frequently observed in dysgenic males. The sterility manifestations depended
      on the strain, the growing temperature and the age of the flies used in crosses. 
      The observed gonadal sterility and other HD manifestations correlated with the
      absence of maternal piRNAs homologous to Penelope and other transposons in the
      early dysgenic embryos. We speculate that gonadal abnormalities mimicking several
      known sterility mutations probably result from the disturbance of developmental
      gene expression machinery due to the activation of unrelated families of
      transposons in early dysgenic embryos.

AB  - Sexual selection within populations can play an important role in speciation when
      divergence in mating signals and their corresponding preferences occur along
      different coevolutionary trajectories in different populations. In insects, one
      potential target of sexual selection is the blend of cuticular hydrocarbons
      (CHCs), which often show intra- and interspecific variation, sexual dimorphism
      and may act as pheromones. In Drosophila montana, a cold-adapted, circumboreal
      member of the Drosophila virilis species group, flies from different populations 
      have been found to show significant premating isolation as well as variation in
      male mating signal (song) and female preference. While the role of male courtship
      song in mate choice has been studied extensively, CHCs in this species have
      received little attention. In this study, we identified most of the CHCs found on
      the cuticle of D. montana and characterized population divergence and sexual
      dimorphism of CHC profiles among flies established from three natural populations
      - one European and two North American. We also studied their potential role as
      pheromones by analyzing CHCs of flies used in female-choice mating experiments.
      We report significant populationxsex effects on CHC profiles, as well as
      significant relationships between some CHC principal components and particular
      mating behaviours, such as female attractiveness and male mating success,
      providing evidence that CHCs may play a role in mate choice in this species. The 
      study also provides evidence for variation in the degree to which CHCs play a
      role in chemical communication among these populations, which may have an
      influence on the speciation process itself, and could be due to variation in
      interactions with other closely-related species that occur sympatrically with D. 
      montana in some, but not other, parts of its distribution.

AB  - In the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo, Dpp, a secreted molecule that
      belongs to the TGF-beta superfamily of growth factors, activates a set of
      downstream genes to subdivide the dorsal region into amnioserosa and dorsal
      epidermis. Here, we examined the expression pattern and transcriptional
      regulation of Dtg, a new target gene of Dpp signaling pathway that is required
      for proper amnioserosa differentiation. We showed that the expression of Dtg was 
      controlled by Dpp and characterized a 524-bp enhancer that mediated expression in
      the dorsal midline, as well as, in the differentiated amnioserosa in transgenic
      reporter embryos. This enhancer contained a highly conserved region of 48-bp in
      which bioinformatic predictions and in vitro assays identified three Mad binding 
      motifs. Mutational analysis revealed that these three motifs were necessary for
      proper expression of a reporter gene in transgenic embryos, suggesting that short
      and highly conserved genomic sequences may be indicative of functional regulatory
      regions in D. melanogaster genes. Dtg orthologs were not detected in basal
      lineages of Dipterans, which unlike D. melanogaster develop two extra-embryonic
      membranes, amnion and serosa, nevertheless Dtg orthologs were identified in the
      transcriptome of Musca domestica, in which dorsal ectoderm patterning leads to
      the formation of a single extra-embryonic membrane. These results suggest that
      Dtg was recruited as a new component of the network that controls dorsal ectoderm
      patterning in the lineage leading to higher Cyclorrhaphan flies, such as D.
      melanogaster and M. domestica.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously, we developed a simple method for carrying out a
      restriction enzyme analysis of eukaryotic DNA in silico, based on the known DNA
      sequences of the genomes. This method allows the user to calculate lengths of all
      DNA fragments that are formed after a whole genome is digested at the theoretical
      recognition sites of a given restriction enzyme. A comparison of the observed
      peaks in distribution diagrams with the results from DNA cleavage using several
      restriction enzymes performed in vitro have shown good correspondence between the
      theoretical and experimental data in several cases. Here, we applied this
      approach to the annotated genome of Drosophila virilis which is extremely rich in
      various repeats. RESULTS: Here we explored the combined approach to perform the
      restriction analysis of D. virilis DNA. This approach enabled to reveal three
      abundant medium-sized tandem repeats within the D. virilis genome. While the 225 
      bp repeats were revealed previously in intergenic non-transcribed spacers between
      ribosomal genes of D. virilis, two other families comprised of 154 bp and 172 bp 
      repeats were not described. Tandem Repeats Finder search demonstrated that 154 bp
      and 172 bp units are organized in multiple clusters in the genome of D. virilis. 
      Characteristically, only 154 bp repeats derived from Helitron transposon are
      transcribed. CONCLUSION: Using in silico digestion in combination with
      conventional restriction analysis and sequencing of repeated DNA fragments
      enabled us to isolate and characterize three highly abundant families of
      medium-sized repeats present in the D. virilis genome. These repeats comprise a
      significant portion of the genome and may have important roles in genome function
      and structural integrity. Therefore, we demonstrated an approach which makes
      possible to investigate in detail the gross arrangement and expression of
      medium-sized repeats basing on sequencing data even in the case of incompletely
      assembled and/or annotated genomes.

TI  - Efficient identification of Y chromosome sequences in the human and Drosophila
      genomes.
PG  - 1894-907
LID - 10.1101/gr.156034.113 [doi]
AB  - Notwithstanding their biological importance, Y chromosomes remain poorly known in
      most species. A major obstacle to their study is the identification of Y
      chromosome sequences; due to its high content of repetitive DNA, in most genome
      projects, the Y chromosome sequence is fragmented into a large number of small,
      unmapped scaffolds. Identification of Y-linked genes among these fragments has
      yielded important insights about the origin and evolution of Y chromosomes, but
      the process is labor intensive, restricting studies to a small number of species.
      Apart from these fragmentary assemblies, in a few mammalian species, the
      euchromatic sequence of the Y is essentially complete, owing to painstaking BAC
      mapping and sequencing. Here we use female short-read sequencing and k-mer
      comparison to identify Y-linked sequences in two very different genomes,
      Drosophila virilis and human. Using this method, essentially all D. virilis
      scaffolds were unambiguously classified as Y-linked or not Y-linked. We found 800
      new scaffolds (totaling 8.5 Mbp), and four new genes in the Y chromosome of D.
      virilis, including JYalpha, a gene involved in hybrid male sterility. Our results
      also strongly support the preponderance of gene gains over gene losses in the
      evolution of the Drosophila Y. In the intensively studied human genome, used here
      as a positive control, we recovered all previously known genes or gene families, 
      plus a small amount (283 kb) of new, unfinished sequence. Hence, this method
      works in large and complex genomes and can be applied to any species with sex
      chromosomes.

PG  - 165-89
LID - 10.3109/15368378.2013.800102 [doi]
AB  - The model biological organisms Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis
      have been utilized to assess effects on apoptotic cell death of follicles during 
      oogenesis and reproductive capacity (fecundity) decline. A total of 280 different
      experiments were performed using newly emerged flies exposed for short time daily
      for 3-7 d to various EMF sources including: GSM 900/1800 MHz mobile phone,
      1880-1900 MHz DECT wireless base, DECT wireless handset, mobile phone-DECT
      handset combination, 2.44 GHz wireless network (Wi-Fi), 2.44 GHz blue tooth, 92.8
      MHz FM generator, 27.15 MHz baby monitor, 900 MHz CW RF generator and microwave
      oven's 2.44 GHz RF and magnetic field components. Mobile phone was used as a
      reference exposure system for evaluating factors considered very important in
      dosimetry extending our published work with D. melanogaster to the insect D.
      virilis. Distance from the emitting source, the exposure duration and the
      repeatability were examined. All EMF sources used created statistically
      significant effects regarding fecundity and cell death-apoptosis induction, even 
      at very low intensity levels (0.3 V/m blue tooth radiation), well below ICNIRP's 
      guidelines, suggesting that Drosophila oogenesis system is suitable to be used as
      a biomarker for exploring potential EMF bioactivity. Also, there is no linear
      cumulative effect when increasing the duration of exposure or using one EMF

PG  - e24542
AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous residents in eukaryotic genomes. They 
      can cause dramatic changes in gene expression and lead to gross rearrangements of
      chromosome structure, providing the basis for rapid evolution. The virilis
      species group of Drosophila contains certain species that can be crossed under
      experimental conditions and their phylogeny is thoroughly investigated. We have
      shown that Drosophila virilis, the most primitive karyotypically and probably the
      ancestral species of the group, is in the process of colonization by a very
      unusual retroelement Penelope which apparently repeatedly invaded the species of 
      the group in the past. However, the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary
      consequences of such invasions are poorly understood. In this commentary, we
      discuss the implications of our recent investigation into the response of the RNA
      silencing system to Penelope invasion of a new host genome which can be achieved 
      in different ways.

TI  - Evolution and dynamics of small RNA response to a retroelement invasion in
      Drosophila.
PG  - 397-408

AB  - Although small RNAs efficiently control transposition activity of most
      transposons in the host genome, such an immune system is not always applicable
      against a new transposon's invasions. Here, we explored a possibility to
      introduce potentially mobile copy of the Penelope retroelement previously
      implicated in hybrid dysgenesis syndrome in Drosophila virilis into the genomes
      of two distant Drosophila species. The consequences of such introduction were
      monitored at different phases after experimental colonization as well as in D.
      virilis species, which is apparently in the process of ongoing Penelope invasion.
      We investigated the expression of Penelope and biogenesis of Penelope-derived
      small RNAs in D. virilis and D. melanogaster strains originally lacking active
      copies of this element after experimental Penelope invasion. These strains were
      transformed by constructs containing intact Penelope copies. We show that
      immediately after transformation, which imitates the first stage of retroelement 
      invasion, Penelope undergoes transposition predominantly in somatic tissues, and 
      may produce siRNAs that are apparently unable to completely silence its activity.
      However, at the later stages of colonization Penelope copies may jump into one of
      the piRNA-clusters, which results in production of homologous piRNAs that are
      maternally deposited and can silence euchromatic transcriptionally active copies 
      of Penelope in trans and, hence, prevent further amplification of the invader in 
      the host genome. Intact Penelope copies and different classes of Penelope-derived
      small RNAs were found in most geographical strains of D. virilis collected
      throughout the world. Importantly, all strains of this species containing
      full-length Penelope tested do not produce gonadal sterility in dysgenic crosses 
      and, hence, exhibit neutral cytotype. To understand whether RNA interference
      mechanism able to target Penelope operates in related species of the virilis
      group, we correlated the presence of full-length and potentially active Penelope 
      with the occurrence of piRNAs homologous to this transposable element in the
      ovaries of species comprising the group. It was demonstrated that
      Penelope-derived piRNAs are present in all virilis group species containing
      full-length but transcriptionally silent copies of this element that probably
      represent the remnants of its previous invasions taking place in the course of
      the virilis species divergent evolution.

AB  - The identification of transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, and
      transcriptional target genes often relies on the integration of gene expression
      profiling and computational cis-regulatory sequence analysis. Methods for the
      prediction of cis-regulatory elements can take advantage of comparative genomics 
      to increase signal-to-noise levels. However, gene expression data are usually
      derived from only one species. Here we investigate tissue-specific cross-species 
      gene expression profiling by high-throughput sequencing, combined with
      cross-species motif discovery. First, we compared different methods for
      expression level quantification and cross-species integration using Tag-seq data.
      Using the optimal pipeline, we derived a set of genes with conserved expression
      during retinal determination across Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila yakuba,
      and Drosophila virilis. These genes are enriched for binding sites of eye-related
      transcription factors including the zinc-finger Glass, a master regulator of
      photoreceptor differentiation. Validation of predicted Glass targets using
      RNA-seq in homozygous glass mutants confirms that the majority of our predictions
      are expressed downstream from Glass. Finally, we tested nine candidate enhancers 
      by in vivo reporter assays and found eight of them to drive GFP in the eye disc, 
      of which seven colocalize with the Glass protein, namely, scrt, chp, dpr10,
      CG6329, retn, Lim3, and dmrt99B. In conclusion, we show for the first time the
      combined use of cross-species expression profiling with cross-species motif
      discovery as a method to define a core developmental program, and we augment the 
      candidate Glass targetome from a single known target gene, lozenge, to at least
      62 conserved transcriptional targets.

PG  - 115-23
LID - 10.1007/s10126-012-9474-z [doi]
AB  - Penelope, originally found as a key element responsible for the hybrid dysgenesis
      in Drosophila virilis, has been widely conserved throughout eukaryotic genomes.
      In other organisms, they are often referred to as Penelope-like elements or PLEs.
      In this study, we found two types of PLEs, designated MjPLE01 and MjPLE02, from
      kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus. There was no observed nucleotide
      similarity between MjPLE01 and 02, and both elements differed from each other in 
      terms of their structure; MjPLE02 has a distinctive endonuclease (EN) domain at
      the C-terminus while MjPLE01 do not. A phylogenetic tree that includes publicly
      available PLEs and TERTs showed that MjPLE01 and 02 were closely related to
      Coprina elements, which have been reported as an EN-deficient PLE, and to
      Penelope-Poseidon group, which possess an EN domain, respectively. Genomic
      Southern blot analysis using MjPLE01 as a probe showed several multiple bands
      that differ among individual shrimps. On the other hand, two major identical
      bands were observed when MjPLE02 was used. Colony hybridization showed
      co-localization of MjPLE01 and GGTTA repeats, suggesting that MjPLE01 might be
      prevalent in subtelomeric regions of kuruma shrimp genome. These results suggest 
      that the kuruma shrimp genome has at least two types of PLEs with different
      domain compositions, phylogenetic positions, and probably chromosomeal
      localization. Such distinctive types of PLEs in an organism have never been
      described and hence could be a potential source to understand how multiple PLE
      types evolved.

      polymorphic Drosophila virilis phylad inversions.
PG  - 71-4
LID - 10.4161/fly.19423 [doi]
AB  - Chromosomal inversions can originate from breakage and repair by non-homologous
      end-joining. Nevertheless, they can also originate from ectopic recombination
      between transposable elements located on the same chromosome inserted in opposite
      orientations. Here, we show that a MITE element (DAIBAM), previously involved in 
      the origin of one Drosophila americana polymorphic inversion, is also involved in
      the origin of one fixed inversion between D. virilis and D. americana and another
      D. americana polymorphic inversion. Therefore, DAIBAM is responsible for at least
      20% of the chromosomal rearrangements that are observed within and between
      species of the virilis phylad (D. virilis, D. lummei, D. novamexicana and D.
      americana), having thus played a significant role in the chromosomal evolution of
      this group of closely related species.

TI  - The role of vertical and horizontal transfer in the evolution of Paris-like
      elements in drosophilid species.
PG  - 1487-97
LID - 10.1007/s10709-012-9648-7 [doi]
AB  - The transposable element (TE) Paris was described in a Drosophila virilis strain 
      (virilis species group) as causing a hybrid dysgenesis with other mobile genetic 
      elements. Since then, the element Paris has only been found in D. buzzatii, a
      species from the repleta group. In this study, we performed a search for
      Paris-like elements in 56 species of drosophilids to improve the knowledge about 
      the distribution and evolution of this element. Paris-like elements were found in
      30 species from the Drosophila genus, 15 species from the Drosophila subgenus and
      15 species from the Sophophora subgenus. Analysis of the complete sequences
      obtained from the complete available Drosophila genomes has shown that there are 
      putative active elements in five species (D. elegans, D. kikkawai, D. ananassae, 
      D. pseudoobscura and D. mojavensis). The Paris-like elements showed an
      approximately 242-bp-long terminal inverted repeats in the 5' and 3' boundaries
      (called LIR: long inverted repeat), with two 28-bp-long direct repeats in each
      LIR. All potentially active elements presented degeneration in the internal
      region of terminal inverted repeat. Despite the degeneration of the LIR, the
      distance of 185 bp between the direct repeats was always maintained. This
      conservation suggests that the spacing between direct repeats is important for
      transposase binding. The distribution analysis showed that these elements are
      widely distributed in other Drosophila groups beyond the virilis and repleta
      groups. The evolutionary analysis of Paris-like elements suggests that they were 
      present as two subfamilies with the common ancestor of the Drosophila genus.
      Since then, these TEs have been primarily maintained by vertical transmission
      with some events of stochastic loss and horizontal transfer.

TI  - Sequence variation in couch potato and its effects on life-history traits in a
      northern malt fly, Drosophila montana.

AB  - Couch potato (cpo) has previously been connected to reproductive diapause in
      several insect species including Drosophila melanogaster, where it has been
      suggested to provide a link between the insulin signalling pathway and the
      hormonal control of diapause. In the first part of the study we sequenced nearly 
      3.6 kb of this gene in a northern Drosophila species (Drosophila montana) with a 
      robust photoperiodically determined diapause and found several types of
      polymorphisms along the sequenced area. We also found variation among five
      Drosophila virilis group species in the length of the 5th exon of cpo and in the 
      site of the stop codon at the end of this exon. The second part of the study was 
      targeted on a deletion of six amino acids located in the last section of exon 5, 
      which in D. melanogaster, is translated only in one short transcript lacking the 
      following exons. The studied deletion appeared to be extremely rare in the wild
      D. montana population where it was found, but its frequency rapidly increased
      during laboratory culture. qPCR analyses showed the expression level of the
      deletion allele to be significantly downregulated in both the diapausing and
      non-diapausing females compared to the wild type allele. At the phenotypic level,
      the deletion and the decreased expression of cpo transcript involving it did not 
      have direct effect on the incidence of female reproductive diapause, but it was
      associated with a reduction in development time under diapause-inducing
      conditions. This suggests that while the cpo transcript containing the prolonged 
      version of the 5th exon with a stop codon is clearly associated with fly
      development time, the exons with RNA domains included in other transcripts of the
      gene may be more directly related to diapause regulation.

AB  - The importance of high and low temperature tolerance in adaptation to changing
      environmental conditions has evoked new interest in modulations in gene
      expression and metabolism linked with stress tolerance. We investigated the
      effects of rapid cold hardening and cold acclimatization on the chill coma
      recovery times of two Drosophila virilis group species, Drosophila montana and D.
      virilis, with different distributions and utilized a candidate gene approach to
      trace changes in their gene expression during and after the cold treatments. The 
      study showed that cold acclimatization clearly decreases chill coma recovery
      times in both species, whereas rapid cold hardening did not have a significant
      effect. Microarray analysis revealed several genes showing expression changes
      during different stages of cold response. Amongst the 219 genes studied, two
      genes showed rather consistent expression changes: hsr-omega, which was
      up-regulated in both study species during cold acclimatization, and Eip71CD,
      which was down-regulated in nearly all of the cold treatments. In addition, 29
      genes showed expression changes that were more treatment- and/or species
      specific. Overall, different stages of cold response elicited changes mainly in
      genes involved in heat shock response, circadian rhythm and metabolism.

      Drosophila.
PG  - 49-55
LID - 10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.09.015 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have shown that juvenile hormone (JH) regulates dopamine (DA)
      and octopamine (OA) content in Drosophila, and we have shown the influence of an 
      increase in JH level on DA and OA metabolism in young females of Drosophila
      virilis and Drosophila melanogaster. Here we investigate the effects of genetic
      ablation of a subset of cells in the Corpusallatum (CA, endocrine gland
      synthesizing JH) on the DA levels and activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
      tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), DA-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (DAT) 
      and tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) in young D. melanogaster females under normal
      conditions and upon heat stress (38 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic). We show that
      ablation of capital ES, Cyrilliccapital A, Cyrillic cells causes: (1) a decrease 
      in ALP, TH and DAT activities, (2) an increase in DA level and (3) an increase in
      TDC activity in young females. The CA ablation was also found to modulate ALP, TH
      and TDC responses to heat stress. Mechanisms of regulation of DA and OA levels by
      JH in Drosophila females are discussed.

AB  - Previous study revealed that the MRP1 gene ortholog DMRP1/CG6214 of Drosophila
      melanogaster contains 12 exons in the coding region. In the current study, the
      genes of DMRP1/CG6214 from D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis were compared, 
      and the result indicated that D. virilis had an extra intron located in exon 2,
      implying that intron loss or gain might have occurred at this locus. To track the
      evolution of the extra intron (Intron Z), orthologous nucleotide sequences of 37 
      arthropod species were cloned or annotated. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we
      found that Intron Z should present in the common ancestor of arthropod species,
      more than 420 Ma. In addition, we found that Sophophora subgenus species and
      mosquito (Culex pipiens) lost Intron Z independently, showing evolutionary
      convergence.

      intrastrain transposition.
PG  - e21883
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0021883 [doi]
AB  - Transposition of two retroelements (Ulysses and Penelope) mobilized in the course
      of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis has been investigated by in situ
      hybridization on polytene chromosomes in two D. virilis strains of different
      cytotypes routinely used to get dysgenic progeny. The analysis has been
      repeatedly performed over the last two decades, and has revealed transpositions
      of Penelope in one of the strains, while, in the other strain, the LTR-containing
      element Ulysses was found to be transpositionally active. The gypsy retroelement,
      which has been previously shown to be transpositionally inactive in D. virilis
      strains, was also included in the analysis. Whole mount is situ hybridization
      with the ovaries revealed different subcellular distribution of the transposable 
      elements transcripts in the strains studied. Ulysses transpositions occur only in
      the strain where antisense piRNAs homologous to this TE are virtually absent and 
      the ping-pong amplification loop apparently does not take place. On the other
      hand small RNAs homologous to Penelope found in the other strain, belong
      predominantly to the siRNA category (21nt), and consist of sense and antisense
      species observed in approximately equal proportion. The number of Penelope copies
      in the latter strain has significantly increased during the last decades,
      probably because Penelope-derived siRNAs are not maternally inherited, while the 
      low level of Penelope-piRNAs, which are faithfully transmitted from mother to the
      embryo, is not sufficient to silence this element completely. Therefore, we
      speculate that intrastrain transposition of the three retroelements studied is
      controlled predominantly at the post-transcriptional level.

TI  - A conserved long noncoding RNA affects sleep behavior in Drosophila.
PG  - 455-68
LID - 10.1534/genetics.111.131706 [doi]
AB  - Metazoan genomes encode an abundant collection of mRNA-like, long noncoding
      (lnc)RNAs. Although lncRNAs greatly expand the transcriptional repertoire, we
      have a limited understanding of how these RNAs contribute to developmental
      regulation. Here, we investigate the function of the Drosophila lncRNA called
      yellow-achaete intergenic RNA (yar). Comparative sequence analyses show that the 
      yar gene is conserved in Drosophila species representing 40-60 million years of
      evolution, with one of the conserved sequence motifs encompassing the yar
      promoter. Further, the timing of yar expression in Drosophila virilis parallels
      that in D. melanogaster, suggesting that transcriptional regulation of yar is
      conserved. The function of yar was defined by generating null alleles. Flies
      lacking yar RNAs are viable and show no overt morphological defects, consistent
      with maintained transcriptional regulation of the adjacent yellow (y) and achaete
      (ac) genes. The location of yar within a neural gene cluster led to the
      investigation of effects of yar in behavioral assays. These studies demonstrated 
      that loss of yar alters sleep regulation in the context of a normal circadian
      rhythm. Nighttime sleep was reduced and fragmented, with yar mutants displaying
      diminished sleep rebound following sleep deprivation. Importantly, these defects 
      were rescued by a yar transgene. These data provide the first example of a lncRNA
      gene involved in Drosophila sleep regulation. We find that yar is a cytoplasmic

TI  - ELAV-mediated 3'-end processing of ewg transcripts is evolutionarily conserved
      despite sequence degeneration of the ELAV-binding site.
PG  - 97-107
LID - 10.1534/genetics.111.131383 [doi]
AB  - Regulation of alternative mRNA processing by ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal
      visual system)/Hu proteins is mediated by binding to AU-rich elements of low
      complexity. Since such sequences diverge very rapidly during evolution, it has
      not been clear if ELAV regulation is maintained over extended phylogenetic
      distances. The transcription factor Erect wing (Ewg) is a major target of ELAV in
      Drosophila melanogaster and coordinates metabolic gene expression with regulation
      of synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate evolutionary conservation of ELAV
      regulation of ewg despite massive degeneration of its binding site and of
      associated elements in the regulated intronic 3'-end processing site in distantly
      related Drosophila virilis. In this species, the RNA-binding part of ELAV protein
      is identical to D. melanogaster. ELAV expression as well as expression and
      regulation of ewg are also conserved. Using in vitro binding assays and in vivo
      transgene analysis, we demonstrate, however, that the ELAV-binding site of D.
      virilis is fully functional in regulating alternative splicing of ewg intron 6 in
      D. melanogaster. Known features of the ELAV-binding site, such as the requirement
      of multiple poly(U) motifs spread over an extended binding site of approximately 
      150 nt and a higher affinity to the 3' part of the binding site, are conserved.
      We further show that the 135-bp ELAV-binding site from D. melanogaster is
      sufficient for ELAV recruitment in vivo. Hence, our data suggest that ELAV/Hu
      protein-regulated alternative RNA processing is more conserved than anticipated
      from the alignment of degenerate low-complexity sequences.

      Drosophila virilis group using multilocus data.
PG  - 249-58
LID - 10.1016/j.ympev.2011.04.022 [doi]
AB  - The Drosophila virilis group is one of the major lineages of Drosophila
      previously recognised and it has been used as a model for different types of
      studies. It comprises 13 species whose phylogenetic relationships are not well
      resolved. In the present study, six nuclear genes (Adh, fused, Gpdh, NonA, CG9631
      and CG7219) and the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes (12S-16S) have been used to
      estimate the evolutionary tree of the group using different methods of
      phylogenetic reconstruction. Different competing evolutionary hypotheses have
      also been compared using the Approximately Unbiased test to further evaluate the 
      robustness of the inferred trees. Results are, in general, consistent with
      previous studies in recovering the four major lineages of the group (D. virilis
      phylad, Drosophila montana subphylad, Drosophila kanekoi subphylad and Drosophila
      littoralis subphylad), although D. kanekoi, D. littoralis and Drosophila ezoana
      are here inferred to be more closely related to the D. virilis phylad than to the
      D. montana subphylad. The age of the crown group, estimated with a Bayesian
      method that assumes a relaxed molecular clock, is placed in the late Miocene (
      approximately 10 Mya). The oldest lineages also appeared during this period (
      approximately 7.5 to approximately 8.9 Mya), while the ages of the basal nodes of
      the montana subphylad and the virilis phylad are located in the early Pliocene ( 
      approximately 4.9 and approximately 4.1 Mya). Major cladogenesis events correlate
      to geological and palaeoclimatic occurrences that most likely affected the
      freshwater and deciduous forests where these species are found. The inferred
      biogeographical history of the group, based on the statistical
      dispersal-vicariance analysis, indicates that the last common ancestor of the
      group had a Holarctic distribution from which the North American and the Eurasian
      lineages evolved as a result of a vicariant event.

TI  - Evidence for evolutionary constraints in Drosophila metal biology.
PG  - 679-86
LID - 10.1007/s10534-011-9420-y [doi]
AB  - Mutations in single Drosophila melanogaster genes can alter total body metal
      accumulation. We therefore asked whether evolutionary constraints maintain
      biologically abundant metal ions (iron, copper, manganese and zinc) to similar
      concentrations in different species of Drosophilidae, or whether metal
      homeostasis is a highly adaptable trait as shown previously for triglyceride and 
      glycogen storage. To avoid dietary influences, only species able to grow and
      reproduce on a standard laboratory medium were selected for analysis. Flame
      atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine metal content in 5-days-old 
      adult flies. Overall, the data suggest that the metallome of the nine species
      tested is well conserved. Meaningful average values for the Drosophilidae family 
      are presented. Few statistically significant differences were noted for copper,
      manganese and zinc between species. In contrast, Drosophila erecta and Drosophila
      virilis showed a 50% increase above average and a 30% decrease below average in
      iron concentrations, respectively. The changes in total body iron content
      correlated with altered iron storage in intestinal ferritin stores of these
      species. Hence, the variability in iron content could be accounted for by a
      corresponding adaptation in iron storage regulation. We suggest that the relative
      expression of the multitude of metalloenzymes and other metal-binding proteins
      remains overall similar between species and likely determines relative metal
      abundances in the organism. The availability of a complete and annotated genome
      sequence of different Drosophila species presents opportunities to study the
      evolution of metal homeostasis in closely related organisms that have evolved
      separately for millions or dozens of million years.

AB  - Disorders of germ track cell development that take place in crossbreeding of
      certain lines of Drosophila virilis and lead to hybrid dysgenesis (HD) syndrome
      have been studied. Polar cells and germ line cells were identified with specific 
      antibodies against Vasa protein. It has been shown that abnormalities of
      formation of primary gonads takes place already at the 11-12 stage of embryo
      development and the consequences of germ line cell death lead to disorders of
      gonad development at the following stages of ontogenesis of dysgenic hybrids. The
      start point of germ line cell death in embryogenesis as well as initiation of
      transcription of Penelope retroelement, which is supposed to play a significant
      role in HD syndrome development in D. virilis, were estimated.

PG  - 214-26
LID - 10.1016/j.cell.2010.12.026 [doi]
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, Hox genes are organized in an anterior and a
      posterior cluster, called Antennapedia complex and bithorax complex, located on
      the same chromosome arm and separated by 10 Mb of DNA. Both clusters are
      repressed by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. Here, we show that genes of the two
      Hox complexes can interact within nuclear PcG bodies in tissues where they are
      corepressed. This colocalization increases during development and depends on PcG 
      proteins. Hox gene contacts are conserved in the distantly related Drosophila
      virilis species and they are part of a large gene interaction network that
      includes other PcG target genes. Importantly, mutations on one of the loci weaken
      silencing of genes in the other locus, resulting in the exacerbation of homeotic 
      phenotypes in sensitized genetic backgrounds. Thus, the three-dimensional
      organization of Polycomb target genes in the cell nucleus stabilizes the
      maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing.

TI  - Evolution of diverse mechanisms for protecting chromosome ends by Drosophila TART
      telomere retrotransposons.
PG  - 21052-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1015926107 [doi]
AB  - The retrotransposons HeT-A, TART, and TAHRE, which maintain Drosophila telomeres,
      transpose specifically onto chromosome ends to form long arrays that extend the
      chromosome and compensate for terminal loss. Because they transpose by
      target-primed reverse transcription, each element is oriented so that its 5' end 
      serves as the extreme end of the chromosome until another element transposes to
      occupy the terminal position. Thus 5' sequences are at risk for terminal erosion 
      while the element is at the chromosome end. Here we report that TART elements in 
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis show species-specific innovations 
      in promoter architecture that buffer loss of sequence exposed at chromosome ends.
      The two elements have evolved different ways to effect this protection. The D.
      virilis TART (TART(vir)) promoter is found in the 3' UTR of the element directly 
      upstream of the element transcribed. Transcription starts within the upstream
      element so that a "Tag" of extra sequence is added to the 5' end of the newly
      transcribed RNA. This Tag provides expendable sequence to buffer end erosion of
      essential 5' sequence after the RNA is reverse transcribed onto the chromosome.
      In contrast, the D. melanogaster TART (TART(mel)) promoter initiates
      transcription deep within the 5' UTR, but the element is able to replace and
      extend the 5' UTR sequence by copying sequence from its 3' UTR, we believe while 
      being reverse transcribed onto the chromosome end. Astonishingly, end-protection 
      in TART(vir) and HeT-A(mel) are essentially identical (using Tags), whereas
      HeT-A(vir) is clearly protected from end erosion by an as-yet-unspecified
      program.

AB  - Colonization of a host by an active transposon can increase mutation rates or
      cause sterility, a phenotype termed hybrid dysgenesis. As an example,
      intercrosses of certain Drosophila virilis strains can produce dysgenic progeny. 
      The Penelope element is present only in a subset of laboratory strains and has
      been implicated as a causative agent of the dysgenic phenotype. We have also
      introduced Penelope into Drosophila melanogaster, which are otherwise naive to
      the element. We have taken advantage of these natural and experimentally induced 
      colonization processes to probe the evolution of small RNA pathways in response
      to transposon challenge. In both species, Penelope was predominantly targeted by 
      endo-small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) rather than by piwi-interacting RNAs
      (piRNAs). Although we do observe correlations between Penelope transcription and 
      dysgenesis, we could not correlate differences in maternally deposited Penelope
      piRNAs with the sterility of progeny. Instead, we found that strains that
      produced dysgenic progeny differed in their production of piRNAs from clusters in
      subtelomeric regions, possibly indicating that changes in the overall piRNA
      repertoire underlie dysgenesis. Considered together, our data reveal unexpected
      plasticity in small RNA pathways in germ cells, both in the character of their
      responses to invading transposons and in the piRNA clusters that define their
      ability to respond to mobile elements.

TI  - Evolution of a distinct genomic domain in Drosophila: comparative analysis of the
      dot chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 1519-34
LID - 10.1534/genetics.110.116129 [doi]
AB  - The distal arm of the fourth ("dot") chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster is
      unusual in that it exhibits an amalgamation of heterochromatic properties (e.g., 
      dense packaging, late replication) and euchromatic properties (e.g., gene density
      similar to euchromatic domains, replication during polytenization). To examine
      the evolution of this unusual domain, we undertook a comparative study by
      generating high-quality sequence data and manually curating gene models for the
      dot chromosome of D. virilis (Tucson strain 15010-1051.88). Our analysis shows
      that the dot chromosomes of D. melanogaster and D. virilis have higher repeat
      density, larger gene size, lower codon bias, and a higher rate of gene
      rearrangement compared to a reference euchromatic domain. Analysis of eight
      "wanderer" genes (present in a euchromatic chromosome arm in one species and on
      the dot chromosome in the other) shows that their characteristics are similar to 
      other genes in the same domain, which suggests that these characteristics are
      features of the domain and are not required for these genes to function.
      Comparison of this strain of D. virilis with the strain sequenced by the
      Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium (Tucson strain 15010-1051.87) indicates that
      most genes on the dot are under weak purifying selection. Collectively, despite
      the heterochromatin-like properties of this domain, genes on the dot evolve to
      maintain function while being responsive to changes in their local environment.

AB  - The effect of a rise in dopamine (DA) level as a result of a mutation, stress or 
      pharmacological treatment on the activity of the enzyme of its synthesis,
      alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in females of Drosophila virilis and Drosophila
      melanogaster has been studied. It has been found that regardless of its nature, a
      rise in DA level has a negative effect on ALP activity, which indicates that DA
      down-regulates activity of the enzyme. The effects of bromocriptine (an agonist
      of Drosophila dopamine 2-like receptor (DD2R)) on ALP activity have been studied.
      ALP activity was found to drop in response to bromocriptine in flies. Conversely 
      ALP activity was increased in flies with reduced DD2R expression (i.e.
      Actin5C-Gal4>UAS-ds-DD2R RNA-interference flies) vs. corresponding controls (i.e.
      Actin5C-Gal4>w1118 flies). Bromocriptine treatment of RNAi flies rescues ALP
      activity to the level typical of Actin5C-Gal4>w1118 flies. A change in DD2R
      number or availability was found not to prevent the response of ALP to heat
      stress, but to change the intensity of its response to the stress exposure. The
      role of D2-like receptors in down-regulation of ALP activity by DA and in ALP
      response to stressor in Drosophila is discussed.

AB  - To establish the existence of a central pattern generator for feeding in the
      larval central nervous system of two Drosophila species, the gross anatomy of
      feeding related muscles and their innervation is described, the motor units of
      the muscles identified and rhythmic motor output recorded from the isolated CNS. 
      The cibarial dilator muscles that mediate food ingestion are innervated by the
      frontal nerve. Their motor pathway projects from the brain through the antennal
      nerves, the frontal connectives and the frontal nerve junction. The mouth hook
      elevator and depressor system is innervated by side branches of the maxillary
      nerve. The motor units of the two muscle groups differ in amplitude: the elevator
      is always activated by a small unit, the depressor by a large one. The dorsal
      protractors span the cephalopharyngeal skeleton and the body wall hence mediating
      an extension of the CPS. These muscles are innervated by the prothoracic
      accessory nerve. Rhythmic motor output produced by the isolated central nervous
      system can simultaneously be recorded from all three nerves. The temporal pattern
      of the identified motor units resembles the sequence of muscle contractions
      deduced from natural feeding behavior and is therefore considered as fictive
      feeding. Phase diagrams show an almost identical fictive feeding pattern is in
      both species.

TI  - Simple Y-autosomal incompatibilities cause hybrid male sterility in reciprocal
      crosses between Drosophila virilis and D. americana.
PG  - 779-87
LID - 10.1534/genetics.109.112896 [doi]
AB  - Postzygotic reproductive isolation evolves when hybrid incompatibilities
      accumulate between diverging populations. Here, I examine the genetic basis of
      hybrid male sterility between two species of Drosophila, Drosophila virilis and
      D. americana. From these analyses, I reach several conclusions. First, neither
      species carries any autosomal dominant hybrid male sterility alleles: reciprocal 
      F(1) hybrid males are perfectly fertile. Second, later generation (backcross and 
      F(2)) hybrid male sterility between D. virilis and D. americana is not polygenic.
      In fact, I identified only three genetically independent incompatibilities that
      cause hybrid male sterility. Remarkably, each of these incompatibilities involves
      the Y chromosome. In one direction of the cross, the D. americana Y is
      incompatible with recessive D. virilis alleles at loci on chromosomes 2 and 5. In
      the other direction, the D. virilis Y chromosome causes hybrid male sterility in 
      combination with recessive D. americana alleles at a single QTL on chromosome 5. 
      Finally, in contrast with findings from other Drosophila species pairs, the X
      chromosome has only a modest effect on hybrid male sterility between D. virilis
      and D. americana.

AB  - Current advances in genetic analysis are opening up our knowledge of the genetics
      of species differences, but challenges remain, particularly for out-bred natural 
      populations. We constructed a microsatellite-based linkage map for two out-bred
      lines of Drosophila montana derived from divergent populations by taking
      advantage of the Drosophila virilis genome and available cytological maps of both
      species. Although the placement of markers was quite consistent with cytological 
      predictions, the map indicated large heterogeneity in recombination rates along
      chromosomes. We also performed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis on a
      courtship song character (carrier frequency), which differs between populations
      and is subject to strong sexual selection. Linkage mapping yielded two
      significant QTLs, which explained 3% and 14% of the variation in carrier
      frequency, respectively. Interestingly, as in other recent studies of traits
      which can influence speciation, the strongest QTL mapped to a genomic region
      partly covered by an inversion polymorphism.

TI  - The genetics of postmating, prezygotic reproductive isolation between Drosophila

LID - 10.1534/genetics.109.111245 [doi]
AB  - Many studies have demonstrated the rapid diversification of reproductive genes
      that function after mating but before fertilization. This process might lead to
      the evolution of postmating, prezygotic barriers between species. Here, I
      investigate the phenotypic and genetic basis of postmating, prezygotic isolation 
      between two closely related species of Drosophila, Drosophila virilis and D.
      americana. I show that a strong barrier to interspecific fertilization results in
      a 99% reduction in progeny production. A genetic interaction among maternal and
      paternal alleles at only a few loci prevents the fertilization of D. virilis
      females by D. americana males. These loci are autosomal and isolation acts
      recessively; the fertilization incompatibility is caused by at least two loci in 
      the maternal D. virilis parent in combination with at least three loci in the
      paternal D. americana parent. These findings, together with results from
      classical experiments, suggest that male-female coevolution within D. americana
      may have driven postmating, prezygotic isolation between species.

TI  - Isolation, characterization and anti-cancer activity of SK84, a novel
      glycine-rich antimicrobial peptide from Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 44-50
LID - 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.09.028 [doi]
AB  - We report herein the isolation and characterization of a novel glycine-rich
      antimicrobial peptide purified from the larvae of Drosophila virilis. A range of 
      chromatographic methods was used for isolation and its antibacterial activity
      against Bacillus subtilis was employed to screen for the most active fractions.
      The peptide, termed SK84 due to its N-terminal serine, C-terminal lysine and a
      total of 84 residues, was completed sequenced using RT-PCR cDNA cloning. SK84
      contains a high level of glycine (15.5%) and a hexaglycine cluster motif in the
      N-terminal part. SK84 displayed antibacterial activity against the tested
      Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Staphylococcus
      aureus), but had no effect on Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      Escherichia coli) and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans). SK84
      had specific inhibitory effects on the proliferation of several cancer cell lines
      (Human leukemia THP-1, liver cancer HepG2, and breast cancer MCF-7 cells), but no
      hemolytic activity. The results from scanning electron microscopy observations
      revealed that SK84 killed THP-1 cells by destroying the cell membranes. Alignment
      results show that SK84 is a mature protein processed from the pseudoprotein
      GJ19999 from D. virilis, and is very similar to several pseudoproteins from
      different Drosophila species. Our results show that SK84 represents a novel
      glycine-rich peptide family in Drosophila species with antimicrobial and
      anti-cancer cell activities.

      virilis have been investigated in different strains of D. virilis and transgenic 
      strains of D. melanogaster transformed by P-based constructs containing full-size
      copy of Penelope. It has been demonstrated that most of Penelope copies in both
      species carry large terminal inverted repeats (TIR) and contain deletions of
      various size at their 5'end of ORF. Junctions between TIR and ORF usually carry
      microhomology of various length enabling to postulate a hypothesis explaining the
      molecular mechanism underlying the origin of such complex structures. Penelope
      copies usually carry 34 bp repeat located in direct orientation at both end of
      ORF and target site duplications of various length.

TI  - Analysis of two promoters that control the expression of the GTP cyclohydrolase I
      gene in Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 583-9
LID - 10.1007/s10059-009-0072-5 [doi]
AB  - GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) is a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of
      tetrahydrobiopterin. Previously, the Drosophila melanogaster GTPCH gene has been 
      shown to be expressed from two different promoters (P1 and P2). In our study, the
      5'-flanking DNA regions required for P1 and P2 promoter activities were
      characterized using transient expression assay. The DNA regions between -98 and
      +31, and between -73 and +35 are required for efficient P1 and P2 promoter
      activities, respectively. The regions between -98 and -56 and between -73 and -41
      may contain critical elements required for the expression of GTPCH in Drosophila.
      By aligning the nucleotide sequences in the P1 and P2 promoter regions of the
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis GTPCH genes, several conserved
      elements including palindromic sequences in the regions critical for P1 and P2
      promoter activities were identified. Western blot analysis of transgenic flies
      transformed using P1 or P2 promoter-lacZ fusion plasmids further revealed that P1
      promoter expression is restricted to the late pupae and adult developmental
      stages but that the P2 promoter driven expression of GTPCH is constitutive
      throughout fly development. In addition, X-gal staining of the embryos and
      imaginal discs of transgenic flies suggests that the P2 promoter is active from
      stage 13 of embryo and is generally active in most regions of the imaginal discs 
      at the larval stages.

      of this particular copy contains fragment of SGM mobile element. Previously this 
      element was found within hsp70 3'-flanking region of other species of the virilis

      hsp70 gene cluster of different species of the virilis group of Drosophila and
      implicate this mobile element in the evolution of hsp70 genes.

TI  - An X chromosome effect responsible for asymmetric reproductive isolation between 
      male Drosophila virilis and heterospecific females.
PG  - 49-56
LID - 10.1139/G08-102 [doi]
AB  - Reproductive isolation between closely related species is expressed through
      uncoordinated courtship, failed fertilization, and (or) postzygotic barriers.
      Behavioural components of mating often form an initial barrier to hybridization
      between species. In many animals, females are responsible for mating
      discrimination in both intra- and interspecific crosses; males of Drosophila
      virilis group represent an exception to this trend. Using overall productivity
      tests, we show that a lower proportion of D. virilis males sire progeny when
      paired with a heterospecific female (Drosophila novamexicana or Drosophila
      americana texana) for 2 weeks. This suggests male mate discrimination or some
      other kind of asymmetrical incompatibility in courtship and mating or early
      zygote mortality. We used males from D. virilis-D. novamexicana and from D.
      virilis-D. a. texana backcross populations to map chromosome effects responsible 
      for male reproductive isolation. Results from the analysis of both backcross male
      populations indicate a major X chromosome effect. Further, we conduct a male
      behavioural analysis to show that D. virilis males significantly fail to continue
      courtship after the first step of courtship, when they tap heterospecific
      females. The combined results of a major X chromosome effect and the observation 
      that D. virilis males walk away from females after tapping suggest that future
      studies should concentrate on the identification of X-linked genes affecting the 
      ability of males to recognize conspecific females.

LID - 10.1101/gad.1698108 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of gene transcription is critical for the proper development and
      growth of an organism. The transcription of protein-coding genes initiates at the
      RNA polymerase II core promoter, which is a diverse module that can be controlled
      by many different elements such as the TATA box and downstream core promoter
      element (DPE). To understand the basis for core promoter diversity, we explored
      potential biological functions of the DPE. We found that nearly all of the
      Drosophila homeotic (Hox) gene promoters, which lack TATA-box elements, contain
      functionally important DPE motifs that are conserved from Drosophila melanogaster
      to Drosophila virilis. We then discovered that Caudal, a sequence-specific
      transcription factor and key regulator of the Hox gene network, activates
      transcription with a distinct preference for the DPE relative to the TATA box.
      The specificity of Caudal activation for the DPE is particularly striking when a 
      BRE(u) core promoter motif is associated with the TATA box. These findings show
      that Caudal is a DPE-specific activator and exemplify how core promoter diversity
      can be used to establish complex regulatory networks.

TI  - Gene structure of Drosophila diaphorase-1: diversity of transcripts in adult
      males and females, in different organs and at different stages of development.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - The gene EG:22E5.5 or CG4199 (accession number O77266, Q9W529) from Berkeley
      Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) was found using the partial amino acid sequences
      of three tryptic peptides obtained from purified Drosophila virilis diaphorase-1.
      This gene is located on the X chromosome at position 2C9-2C10. The structure of
      the gene reveals three exons and two long introns. Using BDGP, we found six
      transcripts in this gene. The difference between these transcripts is in their 5'
      ends; the 3' ends of the six transcripts are identical. Thirty-four ESTs from
      different cDNA libraries were found, most of them from Schneider L2 cell culture 
      (SH) cDNA library. The transcripts are represented at very low level in the cells
      of different organs and at different stages of Drosophila development. Using
      RT-PCR, we obtained five of these transcripts in cDNA samples from female adult
      flies. However, we could not find any of them in cDNA samples from male adult
      flies. Moreover, we obtained only the third transcript (CG4199-RC) in the sample 
      of testis from adult flies and the fourth transcript (CG4199-RD) in an embryo
      sample. None of the other five transcripts were found in the samples of different
      organs and in the samples obtained at different stages of Drosophila development.

TI  - An old bilbo-like non-LTR retroelement insertion provides insight into the
      relationship of species of the virilis group.
PG  - 48-55
LID - 10.1016/j.gene.2008.08.010 [doi]
AB  - In Drosophila, at the population and species level, fixation of a TE insertion is
      an unlikely fate. Of the few reported fixations at the species level most involve
      non-LTR retroelements. In this work we report the fixation of a non-LTR
      retroelement in five species (Drosophila littoralis, Drosophila virilis,
      Drosophila lummei, Drosophila americana and Drosophila novamexicana) of the
      virilis group of Drosophila. In most species, this TE insertion is being lost
      through the accumulation of small deletions, but there is also evidence for the
      accumulation of large deletions. In the americana lineage an insertion of about
      900 bp of the non-LTR retroelement is a marker for the Xc inversion. This
      insertion is, at most, 80 kb away from the basal Xc inversion breakpoint. The
      presence of a bilbo-like element in D. littoralis but not in D. kanekoi, suggests
      that D. littoralis is more closely related to species of the virilis phylad than 
      to species of the montana phylad, which is in contrast with the traditional view.
      Nevertheless, the phylogenetic analyses here performed using a 7 gene dataset
      suggest that D. littoralis is indeed more closely related to species of the
      virilis phylad than to species of the montana phylad. The re-evaluation of the
      phylogenetic relationship of the species of the virilis group, under the
      assumption of a relaxed molecular clock, results in an estimated age of the
      bilbo-like element insertion of at least 7.5 Mya.

      morphological and cytogenetic characters. Statistical data favoring neutrality of
      the substitutions examined in the Ras1 gene are presented. This character of the

AB  - Gene duplication by retrotransposition duplicates only the coding and
      untranslated regions of a gene and, thus, biases retroduplicated genes toward
      having different expression patterns from their parental genes. As such, genes
      duplicated by retrotransposition are more likely to develop novel expression
      domains. To explore this idea further, we used the Prat/Prat2 gene duplication in
      Drosophila as a case study to examine the aftermath of a retrotransposition event
      that resulted in both the parent and the child gene becoming essential for
      survival. We used the Gal4-UAS transgene system with EGFP as a reporter to
      determine the developmental expression patterns of Prat and Prat2 from D.
      melanogaster (DmPrat and DmPrat2) and Prat from D. virilis (DvPrat). We also
      tested the functional equivalence of the protein products of DmPrat and DmPrat2. 
      We found that each of the proteins could rescue DmPrat mutations, showing that
      the requirement for both Prat and Prat2 in Drosophila is not simply due to
      differences in protein function. In contrast, we found that the DmPrat and
      DmPrat2 genes have developed nonoverlapping patterns of expression, which
      correlate with their respective loss-of-function phenotypes. We further found
      that DvPrat expression is similar to DmPrat during development but differs in
      adult gonads. Thus, the function of the Prat retrogene has not diverged in the D.
      melanogaster and D. virilis lineages, while some aspects of its expression
      pattern have evolved. Finally, we have identified promoter elements, conserved
      upstream of DmPrat and DvPrat, that this retrogene has acquired to drive its
      expression.

TI  - Molecular dissection of Penelope transposable element regulatory machinery.
PG  - 2522-9
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkm1166 [doi]
AB  - Penelope-like elements (PLEs) represent a new class of retroelements identified
      in more than 80 species belonging to at least 10 animal phyla. Penelope isolated 
      from Drosophila virilis is the only known transpositionally active representative
      of this class. Although the size and structure of the Penelope major transcript
      has been previously described in both D. virilis and D. melanogaster transgenic
      strains, the architecture of the Penelope regulatory region remains unknown. In
      order to determine the localization of presumptive Penelope promoter and
      enhancer-like elements, segments of the putative Penelope regulatory region were 
      linked to a CAT reporter gene and introduced into D. melanogaster by
      P-element-mediated transformation. The results obtained using ELISA to measure
      CAT expression levels and RNA studies, including RT-PCR, suggest that the active 
      Penelope transposon contains an internal promoter similar to the TATA-less
      promoters of LINEs. The results also suggest that some of the Penelope regulatory
      sequences control the preferential expression in the ovaries of the adult flies
      by enhancing expression in the ovary and reducing expression in the carcass. The 
      possible significance of the intron within Penelope for the function and
      evolution of PLEs, and the effect of Penelope insertions on adjacent genes, are
      discussed.

AB  - This article covers the origin and development of scientific interest in insect
      and amphibian developmental biology at the Department of Systematic Zoology and
      Zoogeography of the Jagiellonian University. The greater part of this historical 
      account is devoted to Professor Stanislaw Smreczynski (1899-1975), the founding
      father of the Department, and comments on his biography and research achievements
      in the field of animal experimental embryology. A particular emphasis is on
      Smreczynski's contributions to contemporary understanding of early embryonic
      development of amphibians and insects as well as his expertise in Pleistocene and
      extant weevils (Curculionidae). A concise survey of developmental phenomena
      studied by some of Smreczynski's co-workers and followers is also presented,
      including the early embryogenesis of entognathans as well as germ cell
      determination and gonad formation in Drosophila virilis conducted by Jura;
      analysis of oogenesis in Collembola carried out by Krzysztofowicz; investigations
      of insects and tradigrades by Weglarska, and finally research into various
      aspects of ovary structure in diverse insect taxa by the Bilinski group.

TI  - Signals of demographic expansion in Drosophila virilis.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2148-8-59 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of genetic variation within and among populations of a
      species is strongly affected by its phylogeographic history. Analyses based on
      putatively neutral markers provide data from which past events, such as
      population expansions and colonizations, can be inferred. Drosophila virilis is a
      cosmopolitan species belonging to the virilis group, where divergence times
      between different phylads go back to the early Miocene. We analysed mitochondrial
      DNA sequence variation among 35 Drosophila virilis strains covering the species' 
      range in order to detect demographic events that could be used to understand the 
      present characteristics of the species, as well as its differences from other
      members of the group. RESULTS: Drosophila virilis showed very low nucleotide
      diversity with haplotypes distributed in a star-like network, consistent with a
      recent world-wide exponential expansion possibly associated either with
      domestication or post-glacial colonization. All analyses point towards a rapid
      population expansion. Coalescence models support this interpretation. The central
      haplotype in the network, which could be interpreted as ancestral, is widely
      distributed and gives no information about the geographical origin of the
      population expansion. The species showed no geographic structure in the
      distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes, in contrast to results of a recent
      microsatellite-based analysis. CONCLUSION: The lack of geographic structure and
      the star-like topology depicted by the D. virilis haplotypes indicate a pattern
      of global demographic expansion, probably related to human movements, although
      this interpretation cannot be distinguished from a selective sweep in the
      mitochondrial DNA until nuclear sequence data become available. The particular
      behavioural traits of this species, including weak species-discrimination and
      intraspecific mate choice exercised by the females, can be understood from this
      perspective.

AB  - Species of the D. virilis group are widely used in evolutionary research, but the
      individuals of different species are difficult to distinguish from each other
      morphologically. We constructed a fast and easy microsatellite-based
      identification method for the species of the group occurring sympatrically in
      northern Europe. The neighbor joining tree based on 14 microsatellite loci also
      gave a good resolution of the species divergence pattern in the whole group.

TI  - Variation in male courtship song traits in Drosophila virilis: the effects of
      selection and drift on song divergence at the intraspecific level.
PG  - 82-92
AB  - Genetic and phenotypic divergence of Drosophila virilis laboratory strains
      originating from different parts of the species range were studied with the aid
      of microsatellite markers and by analysing male courtship songs. The strains from
      America, Europe, continental Asia and Japan showed moderate geographic clustering
      both at the genetic level and in several traits of the male song. The genetic
      distances and the song divergence of the strains did not show significant
      association, which suggests that the songs have not diverged solely as a
      side-effect of genetic divergence. Comparison of the songs of the laboratory
      strains to those of freshly collected strains showed that pulse characters of the
      song are quite sensitive to culture conditions. While laboratory rearing of the
      flies had no effect on the number of pulses in a pulse train or the pulse train
      length, the tendency of the sound pulses to become longer during laboratory
      maintenance could explain the lack of geographic variation in pulse length and
      inter pulse interval. Sensitivity of songs to culturing conditions should be
      taken in account in studies on song divergence.

AB  - The effect of various duration of heat stress (38 degrees C) on the activity of
      ecdysone 20-monooxygenase converting ecdysone into 20-hydroxyecdysone has been
      studied in D. virilis of wild type and mutant strain females, which differ by the
      mode of heat stress response of ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone. We are the first
      to show that heat stress induces activity of ecdysone 20-monooxygenase in
      Drosophila females and enzyme activity correlates with the level of
      20-hydroxyecdysone.

TI  - Role of ecdysone 20-monooxygenase in regulation of 20-hydroxyecdysone levels by
      juvenile hormone and biogenic amines in Drosophila.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - The effects of increased levels of dopamine (feeding flies with dopamine
      precursor, L: -dihydroxyphenylalanine) and octopamine (feeding flies with
      octopamine) on ecdysone 20-monooxygenase activity in young (2 days old) wild type
      females (the strain wt) of Drosophila virilis have been studied. L:
      -dihydroxyphenylalanine and octopamine feeding increases ecdysone
      20-monooxygenase activity by a factor of 1.6 and 1.7, respectively. Ecdysone
      20-monooxygenase activity in the young (1 day old) octopamineless females of the 
      strain Tbetah ( nM18 ), in females of the strain P845 (precursor of Tbetah ( nM18
      ) strain) and in wild type females (Canton S) of Drosophila melanogaster have
      been measured. The absence of octopamine leads to a considerable decrease in the 
      enzyme activity. We have also studied the effects of juvenile hormone application
      on ecdysone 20-monooxygenase activity in 2-day-old wt females of D. virilis and
      demonstrated that an increase in juvenile hormone titre leads to an increase in
      the enzyme activity. We discuss the supposition that ecdysone 20-monooxygenase
      occupies a key position in the regulation of 20-hydroxyecdysone titre under the
      conditions that lead to changes in juvenile hormone titre and biogenic amine
      levels.

TI  - The extent of variation in male song, wing and genital characters among
      allopatric Drosophila montana populations.
PG  - 1591-601
AB  - Drosophila montana, a species of the Drosophila virilis group, has distributed
      around the northern hemisphere. Phylogeographic analyses of two North American
      and one Eurasian population of this species offer a good background for the
      studies on the extent of variation in phenotypic traits between populations as
      well as for tracing the selection pressures likely to play a role in character
      divergence. In the present paper, we studied variation in the male courtship
      song, wing and genital characters among flies from Colorado (USA), Vancouver
      (Canada) and Oulanka (Finland) populations. The phenotypic divergence among
      populations did not coincide with the extent of their genetic divergence,
      suggesting that the characters are not evolving neutrally. Divergence in
      phenotypic traits was especially high between the Colorado and Vancouver
      populations, which are closer to each other in terms of their mtDNA genotypes
      than they are to the Oulanka population. The males of the Colorado population
      showed high divergence especially in song traits and the males of the Vancouver
      population in wing characters. Among the male song traits, two characters known
      to be under sexual selection and a trait important in species recognition
      differed clearly between populations, implying a history of directional and/or
      diversifying rather than balancing selection. The population divergence in wing
      characters is likely to have been enhanced by natural selection associated with
      environmental factors, whereas the male genitalia traits may have been influenced
      by sexual selection and/or sexual conflict.

TI  - Juvenile hormonal activity of mono- and polyenehomobenzenes in Drosophila
      virilis, Spodoptera frugiperda and Araschnia levana.
PG  - 809-14
AB  - A series of mono- and polyenehomobenzenes was synthesised by a highly
      regioselective palladium-catalysed allylic alkylation of substituted and
      unsubstituted benzylic Grignard reagents employing catalytic amounts of catalyst 
      and tested for juvenile hormone activity on the fruit fly Drosophila virilis
      Sturtevant (Diptera: Drosophilidae), on an important agricultural pest species,
      the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and on
      the map butterfly Araschnia levana L. (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). In D. virilis
      only polyenehomobenzenes with a geranyl chain and a methyl, methoxy or isopropyl 
      group at the para position of the aromatic ring displayed significant juvenile
      hormonal activity at low doses. A monoenehomobenzene and polyenehomobenzenes with
      longer allylic chains or without a substituted aromatic ring were not active. In 
      S. frugiperda and in A. levana, a mono-, a di- and a tetraene displayed juvenile 
      hormonal activity. In the lepidopteran species, a trend for the necessity of a
      substitution at position 4 of the phenyl group for high juvenile hormonal
      activity was also found.

TI  - Genetic analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons and their effect on courtship in
      Drosophila virilis and D. lummei.
PG  - 713-25
AB  - Genetical factors controlling the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) of Drosophila
      virilis and D. lummei, and the effect of CHC on female attractivity were studied.
      A strong sexual dimorphism was found in D. virilis where (Z)-10-heneicosene and
      (Z)-11-pentacosene were major CHC for males and females, respectively. In D.
      lummei, (Z)-9-pentacosene was the major CHC for both sexes. These CHC are under a
      complex genetical control: the level of male (Z)-10-heneicosene was mainly
      sex-linked; chromosome 2 exerted a marked hypermorphic effect on it as well as on
      female (Z)-11-pentacosene; other autosomes had additional smaller effects on the 
      CHC. Further, these two species showed differences in the double bond position
      pattern: Monoenes, with double bonds in (Z)-11 or (Z)-13, were more abundant in
      D. virilis (monoenes-vi), while monoenes, with double bonds in (Z)-7 or (Z)-9,
      were more abundant in D. lummei (monoenes-lu). In agreement with previous studies
      of perfumed dummies, experiments with live females showed that a higher
      proportion of (Z)-11-pentacosene or of monoenes-vi induced D. virilis males to
      court sooner. On the other hand, monoenes-lu showed antagonistic effects.

TI  - Dopamine and octopamine regulate 20-hydroxyecdysone level in vivo in Drosophila.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - The effects of increased level of dopamine (DA) (feeding flies with DA precursor,
      L-dihydroxyphenylalanine, L-DOPA) on the level of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and on
      juvenile hormone (JH) metabolism in young (2-day-old) wild type females (the
      strain wt) of Drosophila virilis have been studied. Feeding the flies with L-DOPA
      increased DA content by a factor of 2.5, and led to a considerable increase in
      20E level and a decrease of JH degradation (an increase in JH level). We have
      also measured the levels of 20E in the young (1-day-old) octopamineless females
      of the strain Tbetah(nM18) and in wild type females, Canton S, of D.
      melanogaster. The absence of OA led to a considerable decrease in 20E level
      (earlier it was shown that in the Tbetah(nM18) females, JH degradation was
      sharply increased). We have studied the effects of JH application on 20E level in
      2-day-old wt females of D. virilis and demonstrated that an increase in JH titre 
      results in a steep increase of 20E level. The supposition that biogenic amines
      act as intermediary between JH and 20E in the control of Drosophila reproduction 
      is discussed.

TI  - Intracellular targeting of telomeric retrotransposon Gag proteins of distantly
      related Drosophila species.
PG  - 8391-6
AB  - The retrotransposons that maintain telomeres in Drosophila melanogaster have
      unique features that are shared across all Drosophila species but are not found
      in other retrotransposons. Comparative analysis of these features provides
      insight into their importance for telomere maintenance in Drosophila. Gag
      proteins encoded by HeT-A(mel) and TART(mel) are efficiently and cooperatively
      targeted to telomeres in interphase nuclei, a behavior that may facilitate
      telomere-specific transposition. Drosophila virilis, separated from D.
      melanogaster by 60 MY, has telomeres maintained by HeT-A(vir) and TART(vir). The 
      Gag proteins from HeT-A(mel) and HeT-A(vir) have only 16% amino acid identity,
      yet several of their functional features are conserved. Using transient
      transfection of cultured cells from both species, we show that the telomere
      association of HeT-A(vir) Gag is indistinguishable from that of HeT-A(mel) Gag.
      Deletion derivatives show that organization of localization signals within the
      two proteins is strikingly similar. Gag proteins of TART(mel) and TART(vir) are
      only 13% identical. In contrast to HeT-A, surprisingly, TART(vir) Gag does not
      localize to the nucleus, although TART(vir) is a major component of D. virilis
      telomeres, and localization signals in the protein have much the same
      organization as in TART(mel) Gag. Thus, the mechanism of telomere targeting of
      TART(vir) differs, at least in a minor way, from that of TART(mel). Our findings 
      suggest that, despite dramatic rates of protein evolution, protein and cellular
      determinants that correctly localize these Gag proteins have been conserved
      throughout the 60 MY separating these species.

      activity in Drosophila under normal and heat stress conditions.
PG  - 587-91
AB  - The effect of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and the juvenile hormone (JH) on the
      activity of the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been studied in young females of
      wild-type Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster under normal conditions 
      and under heat stress (38 degrees C). Both 20E feeding of the flies and JH
      application led to a substantial rise in ALP activity. ALP activity was also
      measured in young females of a JH-deficient strain of D. melanogaster,
      apterous(56f). A decrease in the enzyme activity was observed in the mutant
      females as compared to wild type. A rise in JH and 20E levels was found not to
      prevent the response of ALP to heat stress, but to change its stress-reactivity. 
      Mechanisms of regulation of dopamine (DA) level by gonadotropins in Drosophila
      are discussed.

TI  - [A RAPD fingerprinting of sibling species of the Drosophila virilis group].
PG  - 105-9
AB  - A comparative analysis of the sibling species of Drosophila virilis was performed
      by RAPD-PCR technique using a set of random primers. The degree of relatedness
      was studied by cluster analysis (UPGMA) and multi-dimensional scaling. The
      resulting pattern of species relationships contradicts the classical taxonomy.
      The main result of the cluster analysis is that D. virilis does not cluster with 
      the remaining three species of its phylad, while according to multidimensional
      scaling, D. virilis is equidistant from all the species of its group, from both
      the species of its phylad and the species of the montana phylad. The montana
      phylad is extremely heterogeneous; moreover, the species D. littoralis, D.
      ezoana, and D. kanekoi appear to be closer to the virilis phylad than to the
      other species of the montana phylad, wherein these species are traditionally
      included. The phylogenetic relationships between the studied species discovered
      using RAPD fingerprinting comply with the results obtained using protein markers 
      and quantitative traits.

TI  - Phylogeographic patterns in Drosophila montana.
PG  - 1085-97
AB  - The Drosophila virilis species group offers valuable opportunities for studying
      the roles of chromosomal re-arrangements and mating signals in speciation. The 13
      species are divided into two subgroups, the montana and virilis 'phylads'. There 
      is greater differentiation among species within the montana phylad in both
      karyotype and acoustic signals than exists among members of the virilis phylad.
      Drosophila montana is a divergent species which is included in the montana
      phylad. Here, we analyse the phylogeography of D. montana to provide a framework 
      for understanding divergence of acoustic signals among populations. We analysed
      mitochondrial sequences corresponding to the cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome 
      oxidase II genes, as well as 16 microsatellite loci, from 108 lines of D. montana
      covering most of the species' range. The species shows a clear genetic
      differentiation between North American and Scandinavian populations.
      Microsatellite allele frequencies and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes gave
      significant FST values between populations from Canada, USA and Finland. A
      Bayesian analysis of population structure based on the microsatellite frequencies
      showed four genetically distinct groups, corresponding to these three populations
      plus a small sample from Japan. A network based on mitochondrial haplotypes
      showed two Finnish clades of very different shape and variability, and another
      clade with all sequences from North America and Japan. All D. montana populations
      showed evidence of demographic expansion but the patterns inferred by coalescent 
      analysis differed between populations. The divergence times between Scandinavian 
      and North American clades were estimated to range from 450,000 to 900,000 years
      with populations in Canada and the USA possibly representing descendants of
      different refugial populations. Long-term separation of D. montana populations
      could have provided the opportunity for differentiation observed in male signal
      traits, especially carrier frequency of the song, but relaxation of sexual
      selection during population expansion may have been necessary.

TI  - Apoptosis and autophagy function cooperatively for the efficacious execution of
      programmed nurse cell death during Drosophila virilis oogenesis.
PG  - 130-2
AB  - Programmed cell death consists of two major types, apoptotic and autophagic, both
      of which are mainly defined by morphological criteria. Our findings indicate that
      both types of programmed cell death occur in the ovarian nurse cells during
      middle- and late-oogenesis of Drosophila virilis. During mid-oogenesis, the
      spontaneously degenerated egg chambers exhibit typical characteristics of
      apoptotic cell death. Their nurse cells contain condensed chromatin and
      fragmented DNA, whereas active caspase assays and immunostaining procedures
      demonstrate the presence of highly activated caspases. Distinct features of
      autophagic cell death are also observed during D. virilis mid-oogenesis, as shown
      by monodansylcadaverine staining and ultrastructural examination performed by
      transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, atretic egg chambers exhibit an
      accumulation of lysosomal proteases. At the late stages of D. virilis oogenesis, 
      apoptosis and autophagy coexist, manifesting cell death features that are similar
      to the ones described above, being also escorted by the involvement of an altered
      cytochrome c conformational display. We propose that apoptosis and autophagy
      operate synergistically during D. virilis oogenesis for a more efficient
      elimination of the degenerated nurse cells.

TI  - Mechanisms of programmed cell death during oogenesis in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 399-414
AB  - We describe the features of programmed cell death occurring in the egg chambers
      of Drosophila virilis during mid-oogenesis and late oogenesis. During
      mid-oogenesis, the spontaneously degenerating egg chambers exhibit typical
      characteristics of apoptotic cell death. As revealed by propidium iodide,
      rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining, and the TUNEL assay, respectively, the 
      nurse cells contain condensed chromatin, altered actin cytoskeleton, and
      fragmented DNA. In vitro caspase activity assays and immunostaining procedures
      demonstrate that the atretic egg chambers possess high levels of caspase
      activity. Features of autophagic cell death are also observed during D. virilis
      mid-oogenesis, as shown by monodansylcadaverine staining, together with an
      ultrastructural examination by transmission electron microscopy. During the late 
      stages of oogenesis in D. virilis, once again, the two mechanisms, viz., nurse
      cell cluster apoptosis and autophagy, operate together, manifesting features of
      cell death similar to those detailed above. Moreover, an altered form of
      cytochrome c seems to be released from the mitochondria in the nurse cells
      proximal to the oocyte. We propose that apoptosis and autophagy function
      synergistically during oogenesis in D. virilis in order to achieve a more
      efficient elimination of the degenerated nurse cells and abnormal egg chambers.

TI  - Comparative polytene chromosome maps of D. montana and D. virilis.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - Chromosomal inversion polymorphism was characterized in Finnish Drosophila
      montana populations. A total of 14 polymorphic inversions were observed in
      Finnish D. montana of which nine had not been described before. The number of
      polymorphic inversions in each chromosome was not significantly different from
      that expected, assuming equal chance of occurrence in the euchromatic genome.
      There was, however, no correlation between the number of polymorphic inversions
      and that of fixed inversions in each chromosome. Therefore, a simple neutral
      model does not explain the evolutionary dynamics of inversions. Furthermore, in
      contrast to results obtained by others, no significant correlation was found
      between the two transposable elements (TEs) Penelope and Ulysses and inversion
      breakpoints in D. montana. This result suggests that these TEs were not involved 
      in the creation of the polymorphic inversions seen in D. montana. A comparative
      analysis of D. montana and Drosophila virilis polytene chromosomes 4 and 5 was
      performed with D. virilis bacteriophage P1 clones, thus completing the
      comparative studies of the two species.

AB  - We have used phylogenetic techniques to study the evolutionary history of the
      Penelope transposable element in the Drosophila virilis species group. Two
      divergent types of Penelope have been detected, one previously described, clade
      I, and a new one which we have termed clade III. The phylogeny of some copies of 
      the Penelope clade I element was partially consistent with the species phylogeny 
      of the D. montana subphylad, suggesting cospeciation and allowing the estimation 
      of the evolutionary rate of Penelope. Divergence times of elements found in
      different species are younger than the age of the species, suggesting horizontal 
      transfer events.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny of the Drosophila virilis section (Diptera: Drosophilidae)
      based on mitochondrial and nuclear sequences.
PG  - 484-500
AB  - Regardless of the well-documented virilis species group, most groups of the
      Drosophila virilis section have not been completely studied at molecular level
      since it was suggested. Therefore, phylogenetic relationships among and within
      species groups of the virilis section are generally unknown. In present paper,
      the complete mitochondrial ND2 gene and fragment of COI gene in combination with 
      a nuclear gene, Adh coding region, were used to derive the most extensive
      molecular phylogeny to date for the Drosophila virilis section. A total of 111
      individuals covering 61 species were sampled in this study. Novel phylogenetic
      findings included (1) support for the paraphyly of the melanica and robusta
      species group and at least two subgroups of the robusta species group, the
      lacertosa and okadai subgroups, were distinguished as paraphyletic taxa. In
      addition, (2) present results revealed the sister relationship between D.
      moriwakii and the robusta subgroup, conflicting with current taxonomy regarding
      D. moriwakii, which was shifted from the robusta species group to the melanica
      group. (3) In contrast to the robusta and melanica species groups, monophyly of
      the polychaeta species group, the angor group and the virilis group was
      confirmed, respectively. However, the monophyletic quadrisetata species group was
      resolved with uncertainty. (4) Our analyses of combined data set suggested close 
      relationship between the quadrisetata species group and the unpublished clefta
      group, and the okadai subgroup is sister to the clade comprising of the
      quadrisetata and clefta species groups. Within the virilis section, D. fluvialis 
      and three tropical species groups, the polychaeta group, the angor group and the 
      repleta group, are found to branch off earlier than other ingroup taxa. This
      suggests that the virilis section might have originated in the Old World tropics.
      Besides, the derived status of the close affinities of the quadrisetata group,
      the clefta group, and the melanica and robusta groups is probably the result of
      their adaptation to forests between subtropical and cool-temperate climate. Based
      on the consideration of the phylogenetic placement of the species of the virilis 
      section, we suggest that at least five independent migrations occurred from the
      Old World to the New World.

TI  - Conserved domains control heterochromatin localization and silencing properties
      of SU(VAR)3-7.
PG  - 139-50
AB  - The Drosophila protein SU(VAR)3-7 is essential for fly viability, chromosome
      structure, and heterochromatin formation. We report that searches in silico and
      in vitro for homologues of SU(VAR)3-7 were successful within, but not outside,
      the Drosophila genus. Protein sequence homology between the distant sibling
      species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis is low, except for the
      general organization of the protein and three conserved motives: seven widely
      spaced zinc fingers in the N-terminal half and the BESS and BoxA motives in the
      C-terminal half of the protein. We have undertaken a fine functional dissection
      of SU(VAR)3-7 in vivo using transgenes encoding truncations of the protein. BESS 
      mediates interaction of SU(VAR)3-7 with itself, and BoxA is required for specific
      heterochromatin association. Both are necessary for the silencing properties of
      SU(VAR)3-7. The seven zinc fingers, widely spaced over the N-terminal half of
      SU(VAR)3-7, are required for binding to polytene chromosomes. One finger is
      necessary and sufficient to determine the appropriate chromatin association of
      the C-terminal half of the protein. Conferring a function to each of the
      conserved motives allows us to better understand the mode of action of SU(VAR)3-7
      in triggering heterochromatin formation and subsequent genomic silencing.

TI  - Independence of genetic geographical variation between photoperiodic diapause,
      circadian eclosion rhythm, and Thr-Gly repeat region of the period gene in
      Drosophila littoralis.
PG  - 3-12
AB  - Drosophila littoralis is a latitudinally widespread European species of the
      Drosophila virilis group. The species has ample genetic variation in
      photoperiodism (adult diapause) and circadian rhythmicity (pupal eclosion
      rhythm), with adaptive latitudinal clines in both of them. The possible common
      genetic basis between the variability of photoperiodism and circadian rhythms was
      studied by a long-term crossing experiment. A northern strain (65 degrees N)
      having long critical day length (CDL = 19.9 h) for diapause, early phase of the
      entrained rhythm in LD 3:21 (psi(LD3:21) = 12.3 h), and short period (tau= 18.8
      h) of the free-running rhythm for the eclosion rhythm was crossed with a southern
      strain (42 degrees N) having short CDL (12.4 h), late eclosion phase (psi(LD3:21)
      = 20.2 h), and long period (tau= 22.8 h). After 54 generations, including free
      recombination, artificial selection, and genetic drift, a novel strain resulted, 
      having even more "southern" diapause and more "northern" eclosion rhythm
      characteristics than found in any of the geographical strains. The observed
      complete separation of eclosion rhythm characteristics from photoperiodism is a
      new finding in D. littoralis; in earlier studies followed for 16 generations, the
      changes had been mostly parallel. Evidently, the genes controlling the
      variability of the eclosion rhythm and photoperiodism in D. littoralis are
      different but closely linked. To test for the possible gene loci underlying the
      observed geographical variability, the period gene was studied in 10 strains
      covering all the known clock variability in D. littoralis. The authors sequenced 
      the most suspected Thr-Gly region, which is known to take part in the adaptive
      clock variability in Drosophila melanogaster. No coding differences were found in
      the strains, showing that this region is not included in the adaptive clock
      variability in D. littoralis.

TI  - Evidence for maternally transmitted small interfering RNA in the repression of
      transposition in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 15965-70
AB  - Hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila is a syndrome of gonadal atrophy, sterility, and 
      male recombination, and it occurs in the progeny of crosses between males that
      harbor certain transposable elements (TEs) and females that lack them. Known
      examples of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster result from mobilization
      of individual families of TEs, such as the P element, the I element, or hobo. An 
      example of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis is unique in that multiple,
      unrelated families of TEs become mobilized, but a TE designated Penelope appears 
      to play a major role. In all known examples of hybrid dysgenesis, the paternal
      germ line transmits the TEs in an active state, whereas the female germ line
      maintains repression of the TEs. The mechanism of maternal maintenance of
      repression is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the molecular machinery of
      RNA interference may function as an important host defense against TEs. This
      protection is mediated by the action of endogenous small interfering RNAs
      (siRNAs) composed of dsRNA molecules of 21-25 nt that can target complementary
      transcripts for destruction. In this paper, we demonstrate that endogenous siRNA 
      derived from the Penelope element is maternally loaded in embryos through the
      female germ line in D. virilis. We also present evidence that the maternal
      inheritance of these endogenous siRNAs may contribute to maternal repression of
      Penelope.

TI  - Penelope-like elements--a new class of retroelements: distribution, function and 
      possible evolutionary significance.
PG  - 510-21
AB  - Here we describe a new class of retroelements termed PLE (Penelope-like
      elements). The only transpositionally active representative of this lineage found
      so far has been isolated from Drosophila virilis. This element, Penelope, is
      responsible for the hybrid dysgenesis syndrome in this species, characterized by 
      simultaneous mobilization of several unrelated TE families in the progeny of
      dysgenic crosses. Several lines of evidence favor the hypothesis of recent
      Penelope invasion into D. virilis. Moreover, when D. virilisPenelope was
      introduced by P element-mediated transformation into the genome of D.
      melanogaster, it underwent extensive amplification in the new host and induced
      several traits of the dysgenesis syndrome, including gonadal atrophy and numerous
      mutations. The single ORF encoded by PLE consists of two principal domains:
      reverse transcriptase (RT) and endonuclease (EN), which is similar to GIY-YIG
      intron-encoded endonucleases. With the appearance of a large number of PLEs in
      genome databases from diverse eukaryotes, including amoebae, fungi, cnidarians,
      rotifers, flatworms, roundworms, fish, amphibia, and reptilia, it becomes
      possible to resolve their phylogenetic relationships with other RT groups with a 
      greater degree of confidence. On the basis of their peculiar structural features,
      distinct phylogenetic placement, and structure of transcripts, we conclude that
      PLE constitute a novel class of eukaryotic retroelements, different from non-LTR 
      and LTR retrotransposons.

TI  - Effects of dopamine on juvenile hormone metabolism and fitness in Drosophila

PG  - 959-68
AB  - The effects of dopamine (DA) on juvenile hormone (JH) metabolism and fitness
      (estimated as fecundity and viability levels under heat stress (38 degrees C)) in
      Drosophila virilis have been studied. An increase of DA level obtained by feeding
      with DA reduced fitness of wild-type (wt) flies under stress, and decreased JH
      degradation in young wt females while increasing it in sexually mature wt
      females. A decrease in DA levels resulted from 3-iodo-tyrosine treatment and
      caused a decrease in JH degradation in sexually mature wt and heat sensitive (hs)
      mutant females (DA level in hs females is twice as high in wt females). A
      dramatic decrease in viability under stress and fecundity under normal conditions
      in wt, but not hs, females was observed. 3-iodo-tyrosine treatment also reduced
      the number of oocytes at stages 8-14, delayed oocyte transition to stage 10 and
      resulted in the accumulation of mature eggs in wt females. It delayed maturation 
      of wt, but not hs, males as well, but did not affect their fertility. This
      advances our understanding of the regulation of JH metabolism by DA in Drosophila
      and suggests a crucial role for the basal DA level in fitness.

TI  - Juvenile hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone and dopamine interaction in Drosophila
      virilis reproduction under normal and nutritional stress conditions.
PG  - 417-25
AB  - To elucidate the role of the juvenile hormone (JH) in the control of Drosophila
      reproduction under stress, JH degradation, dopamine (DA) content and reproduction
      were studied upon 20E treatment in Drosophila virilis females of wild type (wt)
      and a mutant, with increased 20E level and decreased fertility, under normal and 
      nutritional stress conditions. 20E treatment of wt flies for 7 days results in an
      increase of DA content in young females, but a decrease in mature females, a
      decrease of JH degradation in both young and mature females, an 1-day delay in
      onset of oviposition and a decrease of fecundity to the level typical of mutant
      flies. One day of 20E treatment in 7-day-old fed and starved flies results in a
      small decrease of JH degradation in the fed females and a great decrease in the
      starved ones. Fecundity decreases in the fed flies to the levels of the starved
      untreated flies in both wt and mutant strains. An oviposition arrest is observed 
      in the treated and the untreated starved, but not in the treated fed, females of 
      both strains. The data obtained suggest ecdysone control of JH metabolism
      mediated via DA.

PG  - 451-6
AB  - Degradation of juvenile hormone and reproductive function during starvation and
      experimental increase of the juvenile hormone titer were studied in wild type and
      mutant D. virilis females incapable to respond to heat stress by changes in
      juvenile hormone metabolism and fertility. After 24-hour starvation, the females 
      of both lines were characterized by a decreased level of juvenile hormone
      degradation, 24-hour delay of egg laying, increased egg laying within 3 h after
      the termination of starvation, and decreased fertility within three days.
      Application of exogenous juvenile hormone also led to a decreased level of its
      degradation and 24-hour arrest of egg laying. Experimental increase of the
      juvenile hormone titer before the beginning of starvation led to a sharply
      increased fertility (number of laid eggs and number of progenies) within the
      first 24 h after the termination of starvation. The dynamics of juvenile hormone 
      degradation and of fertility were similar after starvation and upon application
      of the exogenous hormone. The role of juvenile hormone in the control of egg
      maturation and laying under stress conditions has been discussed.

TI  - A genealogical view of chromosomal evolution and species delimitation in the
      Drosophila virilis species subgroup.
PG  - 664-70
AB  - Chromosomal arrangement was a historically important character used for defining 
      taxonomic boundaries. The Drosophila virilis species group exhibits a series of
      chromosomal rearrangements, and the resulting differences among karyotypes were
      primary characters originally used to define taxa within the group. However, some
      chromosomally divergent forms have not been sufficiently resolved in phylogenetic
      reconstructions of DNA sequences from several nuclear genes. Sequences of
      mitochondrial regions have the potential for finer-scale resolution of closely
      related taxa; therefore, sequences of two mitochondrial genes were used to
      examine phylogenetic relationships within the chromosomally variable virilis
      subgroup. Sequences were obtained from multiple strains of the Palearctic
      species, D. virilis and D. lummei, and the Nearctic species, D. novamexicana and 
      two chromosomal forms of D. americana. Analyses support the recent emergence of
      the different chromosomal forms in North America. However, none of these
      chromosomally divergent forms exhibit reciprocal monophyly of their mtDNA
      sequences, which is the requirement for attaining genealogical species status.

TI  - Trans-splicing of the mod(mdg4) complex locus is conserved between the distantly 
      related species Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis.
PG  - 723-36
AB  - The modifier of mdg4, mod(mdg4), locus in Drosophila melanogaster represents a
      new type of complex gene in which functional diversity is resolved by mRNA
      trans-splicing. A protein family of >30 transcriptional regulators, which are
      supposed to be involved in higher-order chromatin structure, is encoded by both
      DNA strands of this locus. Mutations in mod(mdg4) have been identified
      independently in a number of genetic screens involving position-effect
      variegation, modulation of chromatin insulators, apoptosis, pathfinding of nerve 
      cells, and chromosome pairing, indicating pleiotropic effects. The unusual gene
      structure and mRNA trans-splicing are evolutionary conserved in the distantly
      related species Drosophila virilis. Chimeric mod(mdg4) transcripts encoded from
      nonhomologous chromosomes containing the splice donor from D. virilis and the
      acceptor from D. melanogaster are produced in transgenic flies. We demonstrate
      that a significant amount of protein can be produced from these chimeric mRNAs.
      The evolutionary and functional conservation of mod(mdg4) and mRNA trans-splicing
      in both Drosophila species is furthermore demonstrated by the ability of D.
      virilis mod(mdg4) transgenes to rescue recessive lethality of mod(mdg4) mutant
      alleles in D. melanogaster.

TI  - Evolution and arrangement of the hsp70 gene cluster in two closely related
      species of the virilis group of Drosophila.
PG  - 223-32
AB  - To investigate the genetic basis of differing thermotolerance in the closely
      related species Drosophila virilis and Drosophila lummei, which replace one
      another along a latitudinal cline, we characterized the hsp70 gene cluster in
      multiple strains of both species. In both species, all hsp70 copies cluster in a 
      single chromosomal locus, 29C1, and each cluster includes two hsp70 genes
      arranged as an inverted pair, the ancestral condition. The total number of hsp70 
      copies is maximally seven in the more thermotolerant D. virilis and five in the
      less tolerant D. lummei, with some strains of each species exhibiting lower copy 
      numbers. Thus, maximum hsp70 copy number corresponds to hsp70 mRNA and Hsp70
      protein levels reported previously and the size of heat-induced puffs at 29C1.
      The nucleotide sequence and spacing of the hsp70 copies are consistent with
      tandem duplication of the hsp70 genes in a common ancestor of D. virilis and D.
      lummei followed by loss of hsp70 genes in D. lummei. These and other data for
      hsp70 in Drosophila suggest that evolutionary adaptation has repeatedly modified 
      hsp70 copy number by several different genetic mechanisms.

TI  - Reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities encoded by Penelope-like
      retroelements.
PG  - 14719-24
AB  - Penelope-like elements are a class of retroelement that have now been identified 
      in >50 species belonging to at least 10 animal phyla. The Penelope element
      isolated from Drosophila virilis is the only transpositionally active
      representative of this class isolated so far. The single ORF of Penelope and its 
      relatives contains regions homologous to a reverse transcriptase of atypical
      structure and to the GIY-YIG, or Uri, an endonuclease (EN) domain not previously 
      found in retroelements. We have expressed the single ORF of Penelope in a
      baculovirus expression system and have shown that it encodes a polyprotein with
      reverse transcriptase activity that requires divalent cations (Mn2+ and Mg2+). We
      have also expressed and purified the EN domain in Escherichia coli and have
      demonstrated that it has EN activity in vitro. Mutations in the conserved
      residues of the EN catalytic module abolish its nicking activity, whereas the
      DNA-binding properties of the mutant proteins remain unaffected. Only one strand 
      of the target sequence is cleaved, and there is a certain degree of cleavage
      specificity. We propose that the Penelope EN cleaves the target DNA during
      transposition, generating a primer for reverse transcription. Our results show
      that an active Uri EN has been adopted by a retrotransposon.

AB  - A new recessive, sex-linked, nonlethal in the homozygote, wing mutation in
      Drosophila virilis was studied using a hybridological assay, light microscopy,
      and transmission electron microscopy. The mutants have abnormally small wings;
      the phenotype is attributed to a cell-autonomous reduction in the size of the
      epidermal cells of the differentiating wing. The phenotype is also characterized 
      by abnormally oriented wing hairs, wavy wing edge, temperature sensitivity, and
      some abnormalities in the wing veins.

TI  - A Kunitz type protease inhibitor related protein is synthesized in Drosophila
      prepupal salivary glands and released into the moulting fluid during pupation.
PG  - 855-69
AB  - From the Drosophila virilis late puff region 31C, we microcloned two neighbouring
      genes, Kil-1 and Kil-2, that encode putative Kunitz serine protease inhibitor
      like proteins. The Kil-1 gene is expressed exclusively in prepupal salivary
      glands. Using a size mutant of the KIL-1 protein and MALDI-TOF analysis, we
      demonstrate that during pupation this protein is released from the prepupal
      salivary glands into the pupation fluid covering the surface of the pupa.
      3-D-structure predictions are consistent with the known crystal structure of the 
      human Kunitz type protease inhibitor 2KNT. This is the first experimental proof
      for the extracorporal presence of a distinct Drosophila prepupal salivary gland
      protein. Possible functions of KIL-1 in the context of the control of proteolytic
      activities in the pupation fluid are discussed.

TI  - A multilocus microsatellite phylogeny of the Drosophila virilis group.
PG  - 161-5
AB  - We used a set of 48 polymorphic microsatellites derived from Drosophila virilis
      to infer phylogenetic relationships in the D. virilis clade. Consistent with
      previous studies, D. virilis and D. lummei were the most basal species of the
      group. Within the D. montana phylad, the phylogenetic relationship could not be
      resolved. Special attention was given to the differentiation between D. americana
      texana, D. americana americana and D. novamexicana. Significant differences
      between these three groups were detected by F(ST) analyses. Similarly, a
      model-based clustering method for multilocus genotype data also provided strong
      support for the presence of three differentiated groups. This genome-wide
      differentiation between D. americana texana and D. americana americana contrasts 
      with previous analyses based on DNA sequence data.

TI  - New aspartic proteinase of Ulysses retrotransposon from Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 697-701
AB  - This work is focused on the investigation of a proteinase of Ulysses mobile
      genetic element from Drosophila virilis. The primary structure of this proteinase
      is suggested based on comparative analysis of amino acid sequences of aspartic
      proteinases from retroviruses and retrotransposons. The corresponding cDNA
      fragment has been cloned and expressed in E. coli. The protein accumulated in
      inclusion bodies. The recombinant protein (12 kD) was subjected to refolding and 
      purified by affinity chromatography on pepstatin-agarose. Proteolytic activity of
      the protein was determined using oligopeptide substrates melittin and insulin
      B-chain. It was found that the maximum of the proteolytic activity is displayed
      at pH 5.5 as for the majority of aspartic proteinases. We observed that
      hydrolysis of B-chain of insulin was totally inhibited by pepstatin A in the
      micromolar concentration range. The molecular weight of the monomer of the
      Ulysses proteinase was determined by MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry.

TI  - Evolution of the trans-splicing Drosophila locus mod(mdg4) in several species of 
      Diptera and Lepidoptera.
PG  - 165-76
AB  - The modifier of mdg4 (mod[mdg4]) locus of Drosophila melanogaster (Dme) encodes
      chromatin proteins which are involved in position effect variegation,
      establishment of chromatin boundaries, nerve pathfinding, meiotic chromosome
      pairing and apoptosis. It was recently shown that mRNA trans-splicing is involved
      in the generation of at least 26 different mod(mdg4) transcripts. Here, we show
      that a similar complex mod(mdg4) locus exists in Drosophila pseudoobscura (Dps), 
      Drosophila virilis (Dvi), Anopheles gambiae (Aga) and Bombyx mori (Bmo). As in D.
      melanogaster, most isoforms of these species contain a strongly conserved BTB/POZ
      domain (hereafter referred to as BTB domain) within the common N-terminal part
      and a Cys(2)His(2) motif containing FLYWCH domain within the isoform-specific
      C-terminal parts. By sequence comparison, we identified six novel isoforms in D. 
      melanogaster and show that altogether 31 isoforms are perfectly conserved by
      sequence and position in the mod(mdg4) locus of the Drosophila species analyzed. 
      We found significant differences in evolutionary speed of
      synonymous/nonsynonymous divergence between the various isoform specific exons.
      These results were extended by tree reconstruction analysis based on the evolved 
      FLYWCH domains of predicted Mod(mdg4) proteins in Drosophila and Anopheles.
      Comparative analysis of mod(mdg4) gene structure in species of dipterans
      implicates that several internal inversions occurred making the mRNA
      trans-splicing mechanism indispensable for mod(mdg4) expression. Finally, we
      propose a model for the evolution of trans-splicing implementing effective
      regulation of many alternative gene products in a composite gene structure.

      by alterations in JH metabolism and has decreased JH level and fertility under
      normal conditions. One day of starvation results in a decrease of JH degradation,
      a delay in oocyte maturation, degradation of early vitellogenic egg chambers,
      accumulation of mature oocytes and a 24 h oviposition arrest in both wt and hs
      females. A fertility decrease was observed in both wt and hs females 24 h
      following the end of starvation. JH treatment leads to a decrease of JH
      degradation and an arrest of oviposition for 24 h in fed females. JH treatment
      prior to starvation seems to protect some oocytes from resorption: in JH-treated 
      wt females, fertility increases rapidly following the end of starvation. The
      dynamics of JH degradation and fertility are similar following starvation and JH 
      treatment. The role of JH in the accumulation of mature oocytes and the delay of 
      oviposition under stress are discussed.

AB  - The structure of male genital organs in sibling species of the virilis group of
      Drosophila was examined using methods of multivariate statistics. The differences
      among these species were estimated using 33 indices and 2 angle parameters. The
      intraspecific and interspecific correlation structure of the examined characters 
      and the order of their divergence were established. The key characters with
      respect to forming interspecific differences in the virilis species group were
      identified. Based on these results, the relative systematic positions of the
      sibling species are discussed as well as similarities and differences of the
      pattern of relationships among the species from that generally accepted for the
      virilis group.

TI  - QTL analysis of variation in male courtship song characters in Drosophila
      virilis.
PG  - 263-9
AB  - We have used a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach to study the
      genetic basis of differences between two Drosophila virilis strains representing 
      extreme phenotypes in two song characters, the number of pulses in a pulse train 
      (PN) and the length of a pulse train (PTL). Variation in these characters among
      520 F2 males was studied by single-marker analysis and composite interval mapping
      (CIM) using a recombination linkage map constructed for 26 microsatellite
      markers. In single-marker analysis, two adjacent microsatellite markers on the
      third chromosome, msat19 and vir84 explained 13.8 and 12.4% of the variation in
      PN and 9.9 and 6.5% of the variation in PTL, respectively. CIM analysis revealed 
      significant QTLs affecting PN, located on the X and the second, third and fourth 
      chromosome of D. virilis, while variation in PTL was attributable to QTLs located
      only on the third chromosome.

TI  - HeT-A elements in Drosophila virilis: retrotransposon telomeres are conserved
      across the Drosophila genus.
PG  - 14091-6
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster telomeres are composed of two retrotransposons, HeT-A and
      TART. Drosophila virilis has recently been shown to have telomere-specific TART
      elements with many of the characteristics of their D. melanogaster homologues. We
      now report identification of the second telomere-specific retrotransposon, HeT-A,
      from D. virilis. These results show that HeT-A and TART have been maintaining
      telomeres in Drosophila for more than the 60 million years that separate D.
      melanogaster and D. virilis. All Drosophila species and stocks studied have both 
      of these telomeric elements, suggesting that the elements collaborate, an
      assumption supported by evidence from D. melanogaster that their Gag proteins
      interact. Although the HeT-A sequence evolves at a high rate, the element retains
      the unusual structural features that characterize all HeT-A homologues. These
      features may be involved in the role of HeT-A at the telomere. The Gag protein
      from HeT-Avir is as much like TART Gag from other species as it is like HeT-A
      Gag, suggesting that these Gags are evolving under similar constraints, probably 
      to maintain appropriate interactions with host telomeres and possibly to allow
      collaborative interactions like those seen in D. melanogaster. In addition, we
      have identified a chimeric element, Uvir, carrying a pol coding sequence only
      distantly related to sequences thus far found in any telomere arrays.

TI  - Temporal comparison of Broad-Complex expression during eggshell-appendage
      patterning and morphogenesis in two Drosophila species with different
      eggshell-appendage numbers.
PG  - 629-34
AB  - A central question in biology is how developmental mechanisms are altered to
      bring about morphological evolution. Drosophilids boast a remarkable diversity in
      eggshell-appendage number-from as few as one to as many as nine, depending on the
      species. Appendage patterning in Drosophila melanogaster is well characterized,
      inviting candidate-gene-based approaches that identify the developmental
      mechanisms underlying Drosophilid eggshell diversity. Previous studies show that 
      a combination of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and TGFbeta/BMP2,4
      Decapentaplegic (DPP) signaling determines appendage fate in D. melanogaster.
      Broad-Complex expression integrates EGFR and DPP signaling and predicts future
      appendage position. Here we present our confocal analyses of BR-C
      immunofluorescence and appendage morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster (two
      appendages) and Drosophila virilis (four appendages). Our comparison suggests
      that differences in BR-C patterns among Drosophilids may be strongly influenced
      by anterior-posterior information.

TI  - The Drosophila melanogaster BTB proteins bric a brac bind DNA through a composite
      DNA binding domain containing a pipsqueak and an AT-Hook motif.
PG  - 5389-98
AB  - The bric a brac (bab) locus is composed of two paralogous genes, bab1 and bab2,
      in Drosophila melanogaster. Bab1 and Bab2 are nuclear proteins that contain a
      broad complex, tramtrack, bric a brac/poxviruses and zinc-finger (BTB/POZ)
      domain. Many BTB/POZ proteins are transcriptional regulators of which the
      majority contain C(2)H(2) zinc-finger motifs. There is no detectable zinc-finger 
      motif in either Bab protein. However, they share the Bab conserved domain (BabCD)
      that is highly conserved between Bab1 and Bab2, and the Bab proteins of several
      other species, e.g. Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera and Drosophila virilis.
      Here we show that Bab2 binds to several discrete sites on polytene chromosomes
      including the bab locus, and that the BabCD of both Bab1 and Bab2 binds in vitro 
      to the cis-regulatory regions of bab1 and bab2. Our results indicate that the
      BabCD binds to A/T-rich regions and that its optimum binding sites contain TA or 
      TAA repeats. The BabCD is a composite DNA binding domain with a psq motif and an 
      AT-Hook motif; both motifs are required for DNA binding activity. Structural
      similarities suggest that the BabCD may bind to DNA in a similar manner as some
      prokaryotic recombinases.

TI  - Heat stress affects oogenesis differently in wild-type Drosophila virilis and a
      mutant with altered juvenile hormone and 20-hydroxyecdysone levels.
PG  - 393-404
AB  - The link between reproduction and environmental signals is poorly understood at
      the physiological, genetic and molecular levels. We describe a mutant strain of
      Drosophila virilis that has altered responses to heat stress. Heat stress in
      wild-type females results in oocyte maturation delays, degradation of early
      vitellogenic egg chambers, inhibition of yolk protein gene expression in follicle
      cells and accumulation of mature oocytes. The mutant females have increased
      levels of ecdysteroids and decreased juvenile hormone degradation, and show all
      of the heat-stress-induced reproductive effects observed in wild-type flies,
      without exposure to heat stress. During oogenesis in mutant females following
      heat stress there is an increase in early vitellogenic oocyte degradation and
      some degradation of late egg chambers. 20-Hydroxyecdysone levels, but not
      juvenile hormone degradation, change following heat stress in mutant females.

TI  - Evolution of Gab family adaptor proteins.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - The Gab/dos/Soc-1 proteins form a family of multi-adaptor/scaffolding proteins
      involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. To further understanding of the
      Gab family and the Drosophila Dos protein in particular, we isolated a dos
      homolog from both Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila virilis and compared
      their gene structures and protein sequences with the rest of the Gab family. The 
      presence of two conserved introns confirmed that the dos and gab genes are
      orthologous, but the Caenorhabditis elegans soc-1 gene had no unambiguously
      conserved introns with either dos or gab. However, phylogenetic analysis suggests
      that soc-1 probably represents a divergent member of the Gab family. Apart from
      the PH domain, which is well conserved in all Gab family members, the proteins
      show a low level of sequence conservation. Two tyrosines that probably bind to
      the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains of a tyrosine phosphatase in all Gab family
      members are conserved at the C-terminal end; two other potential SH2-binding
      sites in Dos were also identified, as well as several proline rich sequences that
      might bind to SH3 or EVH1 domains in other proteins. A major partner for
      mammalian Gab is phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma); genetic and biochemical tests
      for a PLC-gamma-SH3::Dos interaction were negative, indicating that if Drosophila
      PLC-gamma binds to Dos, it must do so indirectly or through an
      SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction.

AB  - The Acph gene of Drosophila virilis was isolated from a genomic library and
      sequenced. The gene was organized into 6 exons interrupted by 5 introns. 5' and
      3' RACE identified 3 transcripts ascribed to alternative splicing. One of them
      coded for 435 amino acid residues; and the others, for 403 amino acids. The

TI  - Turnover of binding sites for transcription factors involved in early Drosophila 
      development.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - Despite the importance of cis-regulatory regions in evolution, little is know
      about their evolutionary dynamics. In this report, we analyze the process of
      evolution of binding sites for transcription factors using as a model a well
      characterized system, the Drosophila early developmental enhancers. We compare
      the sequences of eight enhancer regions for early developmental genes between
      Drosophila melanogaster and other two species, Drosophila virilis and Drosophila 
      pseudoobscura, searching for the presence/absence of 104 biochemically verified
      binding sites from D. melanogaster. We also modeled the binding specificity of
      each binding site by the use of well-defined positional weight matrices (PWMs).
      The comparisons showed that turnover of binding sites seems to fit a molecular
      clock, at an approximate rate of 0.94% of gain/loss of binding sites per million 
      years. This intense turnover affects both high and low affinity binding sites at 
      the same extent. Furthermore, the subset of overlapping binding sites is also
      subjected to this high turnover. Conserved binding sites seem to be constrained
      to maintain not only location but also the exact sequence at each particular
      position. Finally, we detected a significant decrease in mean PWM scores for the 
      D. virilis binding sites in the case of Hunchback. Possible explanations for this
      fact are discussed.

TI  - Transcription control of a gene for Drosophila transcription factor, DREF by DRE 
      and cis-elements conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and virilis.
PG  - 101-16
AB  - A DNA replication-related element (DRE)-binding factor (DREF) has been revealed
      to be an important transcription factor for activating promoters of cell
      proliferation and differentiation related genes. The amino acid sequences of DREF
      are conserved in evolutionary separate Drosophila species, Drosophila
      melanogaster (Dm) and Drosophila virilis (Dv) in three regions. In the present
      study, evidence was obtained that there are several highly conserved regions in
      the 5' flanking region between the DmDREF and DvDREF genes. Band mobility shift
      assays using oligonucleotides corresponding to these conserved regions revealed
      that specific trans-acting factors can bind to at least three regions -554 to
      -543 (5'-TTTGTTCTTGCG), -81 to -70 (5'-GCCCACGTGGCT) and +225 to +234
      (5'-GCAATCAGTG). Using a transient luciferase expression assay, we demonstrated
      that the region -554 to -543 functions as a negative regulatory element for
      DmDREF promoter activity, while the regions -77 to -70 (5'-ACGTGGCT) and +225 to 
      +236 (5'-GCAATCAGTGTT) function as positive regulatory elements. In previous
      studies, we observed that expression of the homeodomain protein Zerknullt (Zen)
      represses PCNA gene transcription, by reducing the DNA binding activity of DREF. 
      Here we show Zen downregulates DREF gene promoter activity through action on the 
      region between +241 and +254 (5'-AGAATACTCAACA). In addition, the DmDREF promoter
      contains five DREs. Using a double stranded RNA-mediated interference method, we 
      generated evidence that expression of DmDREF could be auto-regulated by DREF
      through the third DRE located at +211 to +218. In living flies we obtained
      results consistent with those obtained in vitro and in cultured cells. The study 
      thus indicates that DmDREF is effectively regulated via highly conserved regions 
      between the DmDREF and DvDREF promoters, suggesting the existence of common
      regulatory factors, and that DmDREF can be positively regulated by itself via the
      third DRE located in its most highly conserved region.

TI  - Functional conservation of the sex-lethal sex determining promoter, Sxl-Pe, in
      Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 155-65
AB  - The primary sex determination signal in Drosophila melanogaster, the ratio of X
      chromosomes to autosomes, sets the activity state of the switch gene, Sex-lethal 
      ( Sxl), by regulating the establishment promoter, m-Sxl-Pe. We have identified
      and characterized the establishment promoter, v-Sxl-Pe, of the distantly related 
      species Drosophila virilis. Like melanogaster, the virilis Sxl-Pe is organized
      into four sub-domains: the Sxl-Pe mRNA leader and exon E1 of Sxl protein, the
      core promoter, the sex-specific element and the augmentation element. The core
      promoter and sex-specific element of v-Sxl-Pe show considerable sequence
      similarity to m-Sxl-Pe and contain target sites for components of the X/A
      signaling system. While the augmentation element of v-Sxl-Pe also has sequence
      motifs that could function as target sites for the X/A signaling system, it shows
      little similarity to the melanogaster augmentation element. Functional studies
      reveal that v-Sxl-Pe drives sex-specific expression in D. melanogaster embryos
      and that the activity of the virilis promoter is controlled by known components
      of the melanogaster X/A counting system. Although v-Sxl-Pe responds appropriately
      to the melanogaster sex determination signal, it is less active than Sxl-Pe from 
      melanogaster. Unexpectedly, the reduced activity is due to differences in the
      activity of the conserved core promoter, while the non-conserved augmentation
      element functions effectively. These findings suggest that low-affinity target
      sites for the X/A counting system are critical for the functioning of Sxl-Pe.

TI  - [Ulysses retrotransposon aspartate proteinase (Drosophila virilis)].
PG  - 553-60
AB  - Retrotransposones are mobile genetic elements occurring in genomes of bacteria,
      plants or animals. Retrotransposones were found to contain nucleotide sequences
      encoding proteins which are homological to retroviral aspartic proteinases. Our
      research has been focused on Ulysses which is mobile genetic element found in
      Drosophila virilis. We suggested a primary structure of Ulysses proteinase using 
      comparative analysis of amino acid sequences of retroviral proteinases and
      proteinases from retrotransposones. The appropriate cDNA fragment has been cloned
      and expressed in E. coli. The purification of recombinant protein (12 kD) has
      been carried out by affinity chromatography using pepstatine-agarose. The
      obtained protein has proteolytic activity at optimum pH 5.5 like the majority of 
      aspartic proteinases.

TI  - The PRAT purine synthesis gene duplication in Drosophila melanogaster and
      Drosophila virilis is associated with a retrotransposition event and
      diversification of expression patterns.
PG  - 630-42
AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster Prat gene encodes amidophosphoribosyltransferase
      (PRAT; EC 2.4.2.14), which performs the first step in de novo purine nucleotide
      synthesis. Prat mutations have a recessive lethal phenotype that is found for
      other genes encoding enzymes in this pathway. The D. melanogaster genome project 
      has revealed a second gene, CG10078 or Prat2, encoding a protein with 76% amino
      acid sequence identity with Prat. The two genes map to different arms of
      chromosome 3 and have different intron/exon organizations, as we confirmed by
      cDNA sequence analysis of Prat2. With the goal to determine the functional
      significance of this gene duplication, we isolated and sequenced two
      PRAT-encoding genes from Drosophila virilis. We find that the two D. virilis
      genes are orthologous to the two D. melanogaster genes in terms of intron/exon
      organization, amino acid coding sequence, and 5' noncoding sequence. The absence 
      of introns in both DmelPrat and DvirPrat genes suggests that Prat originated from
      a retrotransposition of Prat2 and that the gene duplication has been preserved in
      the two species since their divergence approximately 40 million years ago.
      Analysis of mRNA expression in development shows that maternal expression,
      detected in adult ovaries and embryos prior to the onset of zygotic
      transcription, is present for Prat but not Prat2 in both species. Taken together,
      these findings support the notion that two PRAT-encoding genes have evolved
      distinct functions in both Drosophila species.

TI  - [The unusual mobile element Penelope and its behavior in distant Drosophila
      species].
PG  - 269-79
AB  - The retroelement Penelope isolated from Drosophila virilis has a very unusual
      structure and codes for reverse transcriptase and an endonuclease belonging to
      the UvrC type. As shown previously, Penelope is a key element in induction of the
      hybrid dysgenesis syndrome described in D. virilis, which also involves
      mobilization of several unrelated mobile element families. Here we report a
      successful introduction of Penelope into the D. melanogaster genome by P
      element-mediated transformation. In the new host genome, Penelope is actively
      transcribed producing major transcript which coincides with that detected in
      dysgenic hybrids of D. virilis. In situ hybridization on D. melanogaster polytene
      chromosomes and Southern blotting revealed multiple transpositions of Penelope in
      the transformed D. melanogaster strains. We determined the structure of six
      Penelope copies inserted into D. melanogaster chromosomes. Some transformed D.
      melanogaster strains showed dysgenesis effects similar to those observed in
      hybrids from D. virilis dysgenic crosses.

TI  - Role of X chromosomal song genes in the evolution of species-specific courtship
      songs in Drosophila virilis group species.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - In the Drosophila virilis group the males of the virilis phylad species produce
      courtship song consisting of pulse trains with no pauses between successive sound
      pulses, whereas the males of the montana phylad species produce songs with clear 
      pauses between the sound pulses. We obtained song data for F1 hybrids between D. 
      virilis (representing the virilis phylad) or D. flavomontana (representing the
      montana phylad) females and the males of several species of the D. virilis group 
      to study the interaction of X chromosomal and autosomal song genes affecting
      species differences in song. In crosses with D. virilis females, X chromosomal
      (or maternal) factors masked variation in pulse length despite variation in
      heterospecific autosomal song genes. To the contrary, in crosses with D.
      flavomontana females, X chromosomal genes largely determined the pause length and
      interacted with autosomal genes to determine the pulse length. In the montana
      phylad species, pulse length showed dominance toward shorter pulses and pause
      length toward longer pauses. The first-mentioned trait also indicated the
      epistatic effects of X chromosomal and autosomal components.

TI  - Complex inheritance of male courtship song characters in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - We analyzed the inheritance of two male courtship song characters, number of
      pulses in a pulse train, and length of a pulse train in Drosophila virilis.
      Biometric analyses of song differences among 16 crosses over three generations
      (parental and reciprocal F1, F2, and backcrosses) were performed using two
      different approaches. The joint scaling test revealed significant additive and
      dominance components, and also significant additive interaction between maternal 
      and progeny genotypes. The direction of dominance was toward shorter and denser
      pulses in D. virilis. In addition, planned comparisons (contrast analyses of
      variance) between different generations revealed significant Y chromosomal and
      transient maternal factors and their interactions, with all other factors
      contributing to differences in the means of song characters. These results
      suggest that the genetic basis of courtship song characters in D. virilis is
      primarily of autosomal polygenic nature, with small but significant Y chromosomal
      and nonchromosomal maternal effects.

TI  - Developmental regulation of alternative exon usage in the house fly Vssc1 sodium 
      channel gene.
PG  - 125-33
AB  - Sequence analysis of cDNA clones amplified by PCR from house fly ( Musca
      domestica L.) Vssc1 voltage-sensitive sodium channel alpha subunit transcript
      templates identified 11 putative alternatively spliced exons. Nine of these
      corresponded to the 7 optional exons (designated a, b, e, f, h, i, and j) and 2
      mutually exclusive exons (designated c/d) identified previously in the
      orthologous para sodium channel alpha subunit genes of Drosophila melanogaster
      and Drosophila virilis, whereas two segments represented new mutually exclusive
      exons in Vssc1 (designated k/l) located in a region not previously identified as 
      a site of alternative splicing in para. Diagnostic PCR assays on individual Vssc1
      cDNA templates detected the presence or absence of each putative alternative exon
      in multiple partial cDNAs (42-96 individual clones per cDNA pool) from newly
      emerged first instar larvae, pupae, day 1 adult heads, and day 1 adult bodies.
      Exons h and i were present in all cDNA clones from all developmental stages. Exon
      d was also present in all clones from all developmental stages that encoded
      full-length amino acid sequences; however, 1 of 42 clones from adult head
      contained an exon c-like segment in which the coding sequence was terminated by a
      premature stop codon. In contrast, the frequencies of exons a, b, e, f, j, k, and
      l differed between developmental stages and adult anatomical regions. Analysis of
      the Vssc1 region containing alternative exons a, b, c/d, e, f, h, and i as a
      single amplified cDNA segment identified nine Vssc1 splice variants involving
      these exons. The splice variant containing exons a, d, h, and i was the most
      abundant form in all cDNA pools examined, but the observed patterns of splice
      variant expression were specific to each developmental stage and adult anatomical
      region. Our results document the strong conservation of alternative exon location
      and structure between the Vssc1 gene of the house fly and the para gene of D.
      melanogaster but identify marked differences in exon usage between these species.

TI  - Mussel MAP, a major gonad-duct esterase-like protein, is released into sea water 
      as a dual constituent of the seminal fluid and the spermatozoon.
PG  - 313-26
AB  - Our interest in the comparative analysis of male reproductive-tract esterases in 
      different animal groups has led us to undertake a detailed study of the Mytilus
      galloprovincialis male-associated polypeptide (MAP) throughout the mussel
      gonad-duct tract and at spawning. The results of this work indicate that MAP is a
      major protein in M. galloprovincialis semen, with dual presence in both sperm
      cells and cell-free seminal fluid. Shortly after spawning, the released sperm
      mass is subdivided in diffused cloudy-like and thread-shaped 'clots', in which a 
      soluble-phase MAP may persist as long as the clots keep their compact form.
      Additional experiments involving the incubation of spawned spermatozoa at
      increasing Triton X-100 concentrations demonstrated that MAP is also strongly
      associated with sperm cells. These results were further validated by
      immunofluorescent staining, which revealed that MAP is localized in the mid-piece
      region of spawned spermatozoa. This unexpected finding raises the possibility
      that MAP may play a role in sperm fertility in bivalves. Using whole-mount
      histology and micromanipulation techniques, we studied the structural patterning 
      of the mantle gonad-duct network and assessed the sampling of luminal contents
      from the ducts. Of particular interest is the observation that MAP content in the
      luminal fluid increases from the lumen of the spermatogenic tubules to that of
      the collecting gonad ducts, where MAP is detected at a very high concentration.
      These high levels may lead to a significant presence of MAP in semen and
      consequently to a prolonged survival of sperm spawned at sea. In addition, data
      related to the potential structural similarity between mussel MAP and esterase S 
      of the Drosophila virilis ejaculatory bulb are presented and discussed. Finally, 
      we show that the 64kDa protein of human semen reveals positive cross-reactivity
      with antibodies directed against Mytilus MAP and Drosophila esterase S. Taken
      together, the results reveal mussel MAP as the only esterase-like protein
      described so far whose distribution in the gonad and semen can be specifically
      associated with maturation, transport, emission and survival of spermatozoa
      outside.

TI  - Penelope retroelements from Drosophila virilis are active after transformation of
      Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 16150-5
AB  - The Penelope family of retroelements was first described in species of the
      Drosophila virilis group. Intact elements encode a reverse transcriptase and an
      endonuclease of the UvrC type, which may play a role in Penelope integration.
      Penelope is a key element in the induction of D. virilis hybrid dysgenesis, which
      involves the mobilization of several unrelated families of transposable elements.
      We here report the successful introduction of Penelope into the germ line of
      Drosophila melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation with three different
      constructs. Penelope is actively transcribed in the D. melanogaster genome only
      in lines transformed with a construct containing a full-length Penelope clone.
      The transcript is identical to that detected in D. virilis dysgenic hybrids. Most
      newly transposed Penelope elements have a very complex organization. Significant 
      proliferation of Penelope copy number occurred in some lines during the 24-month 
      period after transformation. The absence of copy number increase with two other
      constructs suggests that the 5' andor 3' UTRs of Penelope are required for
      successful transposition in D. melanogaster. No insect retroelement has
      previously been reported to be actively transcribed and to increase in copy
      number after interspecific transformation.

TI  - Nucleotide and repeat length variation at the nonA gene of the Drosophila virilis
      group species and its effects on male courtship song.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - Genes found to affect male courtship song characters in Drosophila melanogaster
      are good candidates when tracing genes responsible for species-specific songs in 
      other Drosophila species. It has previously been shown that Thr-Gly repeat length
      variation at the period gene affects song traits in D. melanogaster, which gives 
      the repetitive regions a special interest. In this work, we have characterised
      the patterns of nucleotide variation for gene regions containing two Gly and one 
      Gln-Ala repeat in another D. melanogaster song gene, no-on-transient A, in D.
      virilis group species. The levels of nucleotide variability in D. virilis nonA
      were similar to those found for other genes of the species, and the gene
      sequences showed no signs of deviation from neutrality. The Gly 2 repeat
      preceding the central domain of the gene exhibited length variation, which did
      not, however, correlate with song variation either within D. virilis or between
      the species of D. virilis group. The Gly 3 repeat located on the other side of
      the central domain showed amino acid divergence parallel to the consensus
      phylogeny of the D. virilis group species. The species of the virilis subgroup
      having Asn after the first three glycines in this repeat have simple songs with
      no species-specificity, while the species of the montana subgroup having two Gly 
      or Asn-Ser in this site have unique courtship songs. Amino acid differences
      between the species in this repeat may, however, reflect species phylogeny rather
      than have an effect on song divergence per se.

TI  - Organization, sequence, and phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal protein S3
      gene from Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 147-56
AB  - Ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) is a multifunctional ribosomal protein: it is a
      structural and functional component of the ribosome, and also a DNA repair enzyme
      involved in the DNA base excision repair pathway. Here we cloned and
      characterized the genomic organization of the ribosomal protein S3 gene (RpS3)
      homolog in Drosophila virilis. We then compared gene structure and protein
      sequences of RpS3 from vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. These comparisons 
      revealed that RpS3 genes from plants to mammals have highly conserved coding and 
      amino acid sequences, and also protein size. Further comparisons of the protein
      sequences show that important domains are well conserved in both localization and
      sequence. In contrast, comparison of gene size and organization reveals differing
      patterns and levels of conservation. Whereas invertebrate RpS3 genes are small in
      size and gene organization is variable (from zero to four introns), vertebrates
      have a considerably larger (but variable) gene size and a uniform gene
      organization. The larger gene size in vertebrates is due to increased number and 
      expansion of introns. Although the plant RpS3 genes are relatively small (
      approximately 1.8 kb), their organization resembles that seen in vertebrates. The
      high conservation through different phyla may suggest that RPS3 might be under
      great functional constraints, both in its capacity as a component of the ribosome
      and as a component of a DNA repair system. Finally, electrophoretic mobility
      shift assays indicate that an upstream element binds a nuclear protein(s).

TI  - Lift and power requirements of hovering flight in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 2413-27
AB  - The lift and power requirements for hovering flight in Drosophila virilis were
      studied using the method of computational fluid dynamics. The Navier-Stokes
      equations were solved numerically. The solution provided the flow velocity and
      pressure fields, from which the unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments were
      obtained. The inertial torques due to the acceleration of the wing mass were
      computed analytically. On the basis of the aerodynamic forces and moments and the
      inertial torques, the lift and power requirements for hovering flight were
      obtained. For the fruit fly Drosophila virilis in hovering flight (with
      symmetrical rotation), a midstroke angle of attack of approximately 37 degrees
      was needed for the mean lift to balance the insect weight, which agreed with
      observations. The mean drag on the wings over an up- or downstroke was
      approximately 1.27 times the mean lift or insect weight (i.e. the wings of this
      tiny insect must overcome a drag that is approximately 27% larger than its weight
      to produce a lift equal to its weight). The body-mass-specific power was 28.7 W
      kg(-1), the muscle-mass-specific power was 95.7 W kg(-1) and the muscle
      efficiency was 17%. With advanced rotation, larger lift was produced than with
      symmetrical rotation, but it was more energy-demanding, i.e. the power required
      per unit lift was much larger. With delayed rotation, much less lift was produced
      than with symmetrical rotation at almost the same power expenditure; again, the
      power required per unit lift was much larger. On the basis of the calculated
      results for power expenditure, symmetrical rotation should be used for balanced, 
      long-duration flight and advanced rotation and delayed rotation should be used
      for flight control and manoeuvring. This agrees with observations.

TI  - In situ hybridisation analysis of the X-linked genes in the species of the
      virilis group of Drosophila.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - When estimating the level of DNA sequence variation within and between
      populations or when planning QTL analysis, it is essential to know the location
      of the genes under study. In the present work, five X chromosomal genes, earlier 
      localised in Drosophila virilis and D. littoralis, were mapped by in situ
      hybridisation on the larval polytene chromosomes of four other virilis group
      species, D. a. americana, D. flavomontana, D. lacicola and D. montana.
      Conjugation of X chromosomes of the most interesting species pairs was studied in
      interspecific hybrids. Three of the marker genes were used as RFLP markers to
      examine the occurrence of recombination in D. flavontontana and D. montana hybrid
      females. The gene arrangement of all species studied, appeared to be different at
      the proximal end of the X chromosome, which prevented normal conjugation along
      the most part of the X chromosome. The data illustrating the locations of five X 
      chromosomal marker genes are presented for D. a. americana, D. flavomontana, D.
      lacicola and D. montana.

TI  - Xena, a full-length basal retroelement from tetraodontid fish.
PG  - 247-55
AB  - Mobile genetic elements are ubiquitous throughout the eukaryote superkingdom. We 
      have sequenced a highly unusual full-length retroelement from the Fugu fish,
      Takifugu rubripes. This element, which we have named Xena, is similar in
      structure and sequence to the Penelope retroelement from Drosophila virilis and
      consists of a single long open reading frame containing a reverse transcriptase
      domain flanked by identical direct long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. These
      LTRs show an organization similar to the terminal repeats already described in
      the Penelope retrotransposon of Drosophila but are structurally and functionally 
      distinct from the LTRs carried by LTR-retrotransposons. In view of their
      distinctness, we refer to these repeats as PLTRs (Penelope-LTRs). Whereas the
      element contains a reverse transcriptase, no other domains or motifs commonly
      associated with retroelements are present. In the full-length Fugu element, the
      5' direct PLTR is preceded by an inverted PLTR fragment. Additional elements,
      many showing various degrees of deletion, are described from the Fugu genome and 
      from that of the freshwater pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis. Many of these
      additional elements are also preceded by inverted PLTR sequences. Xena-like
      elements are also described from the genomes of several other organisms. The
      Penelope-Xena lineage is apparently a basal group within the retrotransposons and
      therefore represents an evolutionarily important class of retroelement.

TI  - Brachyury proteins regulate target genes through modular binding sites in a
      cooperative fashion.
PG  - 518-29
AB  - Brachyury proteins, a conserved subgroup of the T domain transcription factors,
      specify gut and posterior mesoderm derivatives throughout the animal kingdom. The
      T domain confers DNA-binding properties to Brachyury proteins, but little is
      known how these proteins regulate their target genes. We characterized a direct
      target gene of the Drosophila Brachyury-homolog Brachyenteron. Brachyenteron
      activates the homeobox gene orthopedia in a dose-dependent manner via multiple
      binding sites with the consensus (A/G)(A/T)(A/T)NTN(A/G)CAC(C/T)T. The sites and 
      their A/T-rich flanking regions are conserved between D. melanogaster and
      Drosophila virilis. Reporter assays and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrate
      that Brachyenteron binding sites confer in part additive, in part synergistic
      effects on otp transcription levels. This suggests an interaction of
      Brachyenteron proteins on the DNA, which we could map to a conserved motif within
      the T domain. Mouse Brachyury also interacts with Brachyenteron through this
      motif. We further show that the Xenopus and mouse Brachyury homologs activate
      orthopedia expression when expressed in Drosophila embryonic cells. We propose
      that the mechanisms to achieve target gene expression through variable binding
      sites and through defined protein-protein interactions might be conserved for
      Brachyury relatives.

TI  - Conservation of gene order, structure and sequence between three closely linked
      genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, the apparently unrelated genes anon-66Da, RpL14, and 
      anon-66Db (from telomere to centromere) are located on a 5547 bp genomic fragment
      on chromosome arm 3L at cytological position 66D8. The three genes are tightly
      linked, and flanked by two relatively large genes with unknown function. We have 
      taken a comparative genomic approach to investigate the evolutionary history of
      the three genes. To this end we isolated a Drosophila virilis 7.3 kb genomic
      fragment which is homologous to a 5.5 kb genomic region of D. melanogaster. Both 
      fragments map to Muller's element D, namely to section 66D in D. melanogaster and
      to section 32E in D. virilis, and harbor the genes anon-66Da, RpL14, and
      anon-66Db. We demonstrate that the three genes exhibit a high conservation of
      gene topography in general and in detail. While most introns and intergenic
      regions reveal sequence divergences, there are, however, a number of interspersed
      conserved sequence motifs. In particular, two introns of the RpL14 gene contain a
      short, highly conserved 60 nt long sequence located at corresponding positions.
      This sequence represents a novel Drosophila small nucleolar RNA, which is
      homologous to human U49. Whereas DNA flanking the three genes shows no
      significant interspecies homologies, the 3'-flanking region in D. virilis
      contains sequences from the transposable element Penelope. The Penelope family of
      transposable elements has been shown to promote chromosomal rearrangements in the
      D. virilis species group. The presence of Penelope sequences in the D. virilis
      7.3 kb genomic fragment may be indicative for a transposon-induced event of
      transposition which did not yet scramble the order of the three genes but led to 
      the breakdown of sequence identity of the flanking DNA.

TI  - Nucleotide variation at the no-on-transient A gene in Drosophila littoralis.
PG  - 39-45
AB  - The no-on-transient A (nonA) gene encodes a putative RNA-binding protein, and
      mutations in this gene are known to affect vision, male courtship song and
      viability in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we have sequenced the coding region of
      the nonA gene of Drosophila littoralis and compared it with those of Drosophila
      virilis and D. melanogaster. All portions of nonA appeared to be conserved
      between D. littoralis and D. virilis, while the 5' region of the gene of these
      two species showed high divergence from that of a more distantly-related species,
      D. melanogaster. The same was true for the glycine repeat regions. No significant
      deviation from neutrality was observed in the analysis of intraspecific
      nucleotide variation in 5' or 3' region of the nonA gene in D. littoralis
      population. Also, comparison of D. littoralis sequences with homologous sequence 
      of D. virilis suggests that the gene is evolving neutrally in D. virilis group.
      Divergence of the 5' regions between D. virilis group species and D. melanogaster
      could be a result of positive selection, but this finding is obscured by the long
      divergence time of the species groups.

TI  - Drosophila MEF2 is a direct regulator of Actin57B transcription in cardiac,
      skeletal, and visceral muscle lineages.
PG  - 39-50
AB  - To identify regulatory events occurring during myogenesis, we characterized the
      transcriptional regulation of a Drosophila melanogaster actin gene, Actin 57B.
      Act57B transcription is first detected in visceral muscle precursors and is
      detectable in all embryonic muscles by the end of embryogenesis. Through deletion
      analysis we identified a 595 bp promoter element that was sufficient for high
      levels of expression in all three muscle lineages. This fragment contained a MEF2
      binding site conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis which bound
      MEF2 protein in embryo nuclear extracts. Mutation of the MEF2 site severely
      reduced promoter activity in embryos, and in Mef2 mutants Act57B expression was
      severely decreased, demonstrating MEF2 is an essential regulator of Act57B. We
      also showed that MEF2 likely acts synergistically with factors bound to
      additional sequences within the 595 bp element. These findings underline the
      importance of MEF2 in controlling differentiation in all muscle lineages. Our
      experiments reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for a structural gene where high 
      levels of expression in all embryonic muscles is regulated through a single
      transcription factor binding site.

TI  - Promoter analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding the pterin
      4alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase.
PG  - 233-8
AB  - Pterin-4alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) is a key enzyme in the regeneration
      pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin. Previously, we isolated and reported the
      Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding PCD. In the present study, we isolated and 
      characterized the Drosophila virilis gene encoding PCD. The Drosophila virilis
      PCD gene has two introns and an open reading frame to encode a protein of 101
      amino acids. The amino acid sequence of Drosophila virilis PCD shows a 83%
      homology to that of the Drosophila melanogaster PCD protein. From the alignment
      of the nucleotide sequence in the 5'-flanking region of the Drosophila
      melanogaster and Drosophila virilis PCD genes, we found four conserved sequences.
      Using a transient transfection assay, we showed that one of the conserved
      sequences (-127 to approximately -115) is critical for expression, also the
      minimal promoter region between -127 and +51 is necessary for the efficient
      expression of Drosophila melanogaster PCD.

PG  - 1243-50
AB  - The effect of heat stress (38 degrees C) on the content of octopamine (OA) and
      20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE) was studied under normal and stressful conditions in
      adult flies of Drosophila virilis lines contrasting in the level of the juvenile 
      hormone (JH). The wild-type flies (line 101) exhibited a pronounced sex
      dimorphism for the content of both OA and 20HE, which was substantially lower in 
      this line than in flies of the mutant line 147. The level of both hormones
      increased in flies of line 101 exposed to heat stress, whereas it remained
      unchanged in flies of line 147 under the same conditions. The effect of heat
      stress on the level of JH metabolism and fertility was also studied in D.
      melanogaster wild-type lines and lines carrying mutations in genes responsible
      for OA and DA syntheses. In octopamineless females of the T beta hnM18 line and
      in females of the Ste line characterized by a doubled content of DA, JH
      degradation differed from normal: it was increased in both young and mature T
      beta hnM18 females, while decreased in young and increased in mature Ste flies.
      Fertility was substantially lower in the Ste than in the wild-type line. Flies of
      all of the D. melanogaster lines produced a stress response; however, in mutant
      lines, both fertility and stress reactivity of the systems controlling JH
      metabolism differed significantly from that of the wild-type lines. The role of
      JH, 20HE, OA, and DA interaction in regulation of Drosophila reproduction under
      stressful conditions is discussed.

TI  - [Structure and evolutionary role of the Penelope mobile element in Drosophila
      species of the virilis group].
PG  - 805-15
AB  - The mobile element Penelope is activated and mobilizes several other transposons 
      in dysgenic crosses in Drosophila virilis. Its structure proved to be complex and
      to vary greatly in all examined species of the virilis group. Phylogenetic
      analysis of the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain assigned Penelope to a new
      branch, rather than to any known family, of LTR-lacking retroelements. Amino acid
      sequence analysis showed that the C-terminal domain of the Penelope polyprotein
      is an active endonuclease, which is related to intron-encoded endonucleases and
      to bacterial repair endonuclease UrvC, and may act as an integras. Retroelements 
      coding for a putative endonuclease that differs from typical integrase have thus 
      far not been known. The N-terminal domain of the Penelope polyprotein was shown
      to contain a protease with significant homology to HIV-1 protease. Phylogenetic
      analysis divided the Penelope copies from several virilis species into two
      subfamilies, one including virtually identical full-length copies, and the other 
      comprising highly divergent defective copies. The results suggest both vertical
      and horizontal transfer of the element. Possibly, Penelope invasion recurred
      during evolution and contributed to genome rearrangement in the virilis species. 
      Chromosome aberrations detected in D. virilis, which is now being invaded by
      Penelope, is direct evidence for this assumption.

TI  - [The dopamine system stress reaction in adults of Drosophila virilis is
      controlled by genes of Chromosome 6].
PG  - 61-4
AB  - A linkage group of the gene responsible for changes of DA titer under stress in
      adults of D. virilis was determined. Line 160 of D. virilis, all autosomes of
      which bear visible recessive mutations, was used as an analyzer. Flies of lines
      160 and 147 were shown to differ in DA content under normal conditions and in the
      way DA metabolic system reacts to stress. Among the offspring of the analyzing
      cross, groups of flies were found with one testable autosome from line 147 and
      all other chromosomes from line 160. Results of the DA titer measurements in
      flies of these groups under stress conditions have proved that the gene in
      question is linked to chromosome 6.

TI  - The neuron-specific RNA-binding protein ELAV regulates neuroglian alternative
      splicing in neurons and binds directly to its pre-mRNA.
PG  - 2546-61
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster neural-specific protein, ELAV, has been shown to regulate
      the neural-specific splicing of three genes: neuroglian (nrg), erect wing, and
      armadillo. Alternative splicing of the nrg transcript involves alternative
      inclusion of a 3'-terminal exon. Here, using a minigene reporter, we show that
      the nrg alternatively spliced intron (nASI) has all the determinants required to 
      recreate proper neural-specific RNA processing seen with the endogenous nrg
      transcript, including regulation by ELAV. An in vitro UV cross-linking assay
      revealed that ELAV from nuclear extracts cross-links to four distinct sites along
      the 3200 nucleotide long nASI; one EXS is positioned at the polypyrimidine tract 
      of the default 3' splice site. ELAV cross-linking sites (EXSs) have in common
      long tracts of (U)-rich sequence rather than a precise consensus; moreover, each 
      tract has at least two 8/10U elements; their importance is validated by mutant
      transgene reporter analysis. Further, we propose criteria for ELAV target
      sequence recognition based on the four EXSs, sites within the nASI that are (U)
      rich but do not cross-link with ELAV, and predicted EXSs from a phylogenetic
      comparison with Drosophila virilis nASI. These results suggest that ELAV
      regulates nrg alternative splicing by direct interaction with the nASI.

TI  - Characterization of muscle actin genes in Drosophila virilis reveals significant 
      molecular complexity in skeletal muscle types.
PG  - 333-40
AB  - Actin is a ubiquitous and highly conserved eukaryotic protein required for cell
      motility and locomotion. In this manuscript, we characterize the four muscle
      actin genes of the insect Drosophila virilis and demonstrate strong similarities 
      between the D. virilis genes and their homologues in Drosophila melanogaster;
      intron locations are conserved, and there are few amino acid differences between 
      homologues. We also found strong conservation in temporal expression patterns of 
      the muscle actin genes--the homologues of the D. melanogaster genes Act57B and
      Act87E are expressed throughout the life cycle, whereas the other two D. virilis 
      genes, homologous to Act79B and Act88F are specific to pupal and adult stages. In
      situ hybridization revealed that each D. virilis gene is expressed in a unique
      pattern in the muscles of the thorax and abdomen. These muscle-specific patterns 
      of actin isoforms suggest a greater physiological diversity for the adult muscles
      of insects than has been appreciated to date from their categorization into
      fibrillar, tubular (non-fibrillar) and supercontractile muscle types.

TI  - The nonA gene in Drosophila conveys species-specific behavioral characteristics.
PG  - 1535-43
AB  - The molecular basis of species-specific differences in courtship behavior, a
      critical factor in preserving species boundaries, is poorly understood. Genetic
      analysis of all but the most closely related species is usually impossible, given
      the inviability of hybrids. We have therefore applied interspecific
      transformation of a single candidate behavioral locus, no-on-transient A (nonA), 
      between Drosophila virilis and D. melanogaster, to investigate whether nonA, like
      the period gene, might encode species-specific behavioral information. Mutations 
      in nonA can disrupt both visual behavior and the courtship song in D.
      melanogaster. The lovesong of nonA(diss) mutant males superficially resembles
      that of D. virilis, a species that diverged from D. melanogaster 40-60 mya.
      Transformation of the cloned D. virilis nonA gene into D. melanogaster hosts
      carrying a synthetic deletion of the nonA locus restored normal visual function
      (the phenotype most sensitive to nonA mutation). However, the courtship song of
      transformant males showed several features characteristic of the corresponding D.
      virilis signal, indicating that nonA can act as a reservoir for species-specific 
      information. This candidate gene approach, together with interspecific
      transformation, can therefore provide a direct avenue to explore potential
      speciation genes in genetically and molecularly tractable organisms such as
      Drosophila.

TI  - Ecdysone-controlled mRNA stability in Drosophila salivary glands:
      deadenylation-independent degradation of larval glue protein gene message during 
      the larval/prepupal transition.
PG  - 129-44
AB  - 20-Hydroxyecdysone induces poly(A) shortening and the subsequent degradation of
      transcripts encoding the larval glue protein LGP-1 in Drosophila virilis late
      third larval instar salivary glands. Degradation concurs with the transient
      increase of ribonucleolytic activities in the gland cells. In vitro nuclease
      assays using crude cytoplasmic extracts of ecdysone-treated salivary glands
      demonstrate degradation to be deadenylation-independent and that the induced
      ribonucleolytic activities initiate the degradation of the Lgp-1 transcripts in
      putative single-stranded loop regions. The independence of degradation from
      deadenylation is also found in vivo in transformed D. melanogaster carrying a
      modified Lgp-1 gene.

TI  - Fish retroposons related to the Penelope element of Drosophila virilis define a
      new group of retrotransposable elements.
PG  - 711-20
AB  - Poseidon and Neptune are two ancient lineages of retroposons related to the
      Penelope element from Drosophila virilis. They have been identified in various
      teleost fish species, including the medakafish (Oryzias latipes), and the
      pufferfishes Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis, whose genomes are
      currently being sequenced. Some of these elements are highly reiterated in fish
      genomes. Penelope-related elements were also identified in blood fluke, shrimp,
      sea urchin, cichlid fish and frog, showing that they are widespread in animals.
      Penelope-related retroposons were not detected among sequences from the
      Drosophila melanogaster and human genome projects, suggesting that they have been
      lost from certain animal lineages. A sequence encoding a putative Uri (also
      called GIY-YIG) endonuclease domain was detected downstream from the gene for
      reverse transcriptase. To the best of our knowledge, this type of endonuclease
      sequence has previously been identified in group I introns and in genes for
      prokaryotic excinucleases but not in retrotransposable elements. Penelope-related
      elements are frequently truncated at their 5' ends and can also be flanked by
      long terminal repeat-like structures. Phylogenetic analysis of the reverse
      transcriptase domain failed to assign Penelope-related retroposons to one of the 
      major groups of retroelements. Overall, therefore, the evidence strongly suggests
      that these sequences represent a new group of retrotransposable elements.

TI  - Evolution of 5S rRNA gene families in Drosophila.
PG  - 403-15
AB  - In Drosophila virilis, the three clusters of 5S rRNA genes on chromosome 5
      comprise two different gene families (B and C), which differ profoundly in the
      organization of their spacer sequences. While C-type genes, which are found in
      two of the clusters, exhibit a true repetitive character, the B-type genes of the
      third cluster are each embedded in completely different genomic environments.
      Southern blots of genomic DNA of different D. virilis subspecies, D. hydei and D.
      melanogaster probed with 5S rRNA gene spacer and coding sequences demonstrate the
      specificity of C-type sequences for the D. virilis species group. The comparative
      analysis of flanking sequences of 5S rRNA genes of D. virilis, members of the D. 
      melanogaster species subgroup and of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala
      reveals the existence of conserved sequence motifs both in the 5' upstream and 3'
      downstream flanking regions. Their possible roles in the control of expression
      and processing of the 5S rRNA precursor molecule are discussed.

TI  - The structure and evolution of Penelope in the virilis species group of
      Drosophila: an ancient lineage of retroelements.
PG  - 445-56
AB  - The Penelope element is the key element responsible for mobilization of other
      transposable elements in the course of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis.
      Penelope has an unusually complex, highly variable organization in all studied
      species of the virlis group. Thc BRIDGE1 element from the fish Fugu rubripes is
      homologous to Penelope, and database searches detected additional homologous
      sequences among Expressed Sequence Tags from the flatworm Schistosoma mansonii
      and the nematode Ancylostoma caninum. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the
      reverse transcriptase of the Penelope group does not belong to any of the
      characterized major retroelement lineages, but apparently represents a novel
      branch of non-LTR retroelements. Sequence profile analysis results in the
      prediction that the C-terminal domain of the Penelope polyprotein is an active
      endonuclease related to intron-encoded endonucleases and the bacterial repair
      endonuclease UvrC, which could function as an integrase. No retroelements
      containing a predicted endonuclease of this family have been described
      previously. Phylogenetic analysis of Penelope copies isolated from several
      species of the virilis group reveals two subfamilies of Penelope elements, one of
      which includes full-length copies whose nucleotide sequences are almost
      identical, whereas the other one consists of highly diverged defective copies.
      Phylogenetic analysis of Penelope suggests both vertical transmission of the
      element and probable horizontal transfers. These findings support the notion that
      Penelope invasions occurred repeatedly in the evolution of the virilis group.

TI  - Identification of X chromosomal restriction fragment length polymorphism markers 
      and their use in a gene localization study in Drosophila virilis and D.
      littoralis.
PG  - 242-8
AB  - We have identified six restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers
      based on unique gene sequences on the X chromosome of Drosophila virilis and D.
      littoralis. The markers were localized by in situ hybridization on larval
      polytene chromosomes, and the conjugation of the X chromosomes of the two species
      was studied in salivary glands of interspecific hybrid female larvae. The gene
      arrangement of D. virilis and D. littoralis appeared to be very different at the 
      proximal end of the X chromosome preventing recombination between RFLP markers
      located in this area. Simple quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis showed that
      five of our marker genes (including nonA and Dmca1A, previously found to affect
      male courtship song in D. melanogaster) are linked with a gene(s) having a major 
      effect on species differences in the male courtship song between D. virilis and
      D. littoralis. This shows that the song gene(s) may be located inside a large
      X-chromosomal inversion in D. littoralis (as previously suggested), but that it
      may also be located on an area between this inversion and the centromere, close
      to nonA and Dmca1A. Localization of this gene or gene complex will be continued
      with the aid of our newly identified RFLP markers by making interspecific crosses
      between D. virilis group species with more similar X chromosomes.

TI  - Promoter analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding transcription
      elongation factor TFIIS.
PG  - 276-81
AB  - The promoter region of the Drosophila melanogaster TFIIS gene was characterized
      by transient expression assay. Serial deletion analysis of the promoter region
      showed that the promoter region between -112 and +113 is required for the
      efficient expression of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene. The results also suggest 
      that the DNA fragments between -112 and -54 and between +94 and +113 contain the 
      vital elements for the expression. The importance of these fragments was further 
      substantiated by the findings that the sequences in these fragments of the D.
      melanogaster TFIIS gene are conserved in the 5'-flanking regions of the
      Drosophila virilis TFIIS gene. The comparison of the nucleotide sequences in the 
      5'-flanking region of the D. melanogaster and D. virilis TFIIS genes revealed
      that the three regions, -85--59, +76-+126, and the vicinity of the transcription 
      initiation site of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene, are conserved. It is very
      interesting that the long downstream DNA between +76 and +126 is highly conserved
      with 90% identities between the two species. The downstream promoter region
      between +94 and +113 of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene was further analyzed by
      transient expression and band mobility shift assays. The results obtained suggest
      that the region between +94 and +113 is probably recognized by nuclear factors
      and that the sequence (+98)AGTAAACAACAT(+109) seems to make a great contribution 
      to promoter activity of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene.

TI  - Characterization of the Hox cluster from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Diptera:
      Culicidae).
PG  - 311-25
AB  - The Hox genes have been found to encode transcription factors, which specify the 
      morphological identity of structures along the anteroposterior axis of animals
      ranging from worms to mice. The canonical set of nine genes is organized in a
      cluster in the genome of several protostomes and deuterostomes. However, within
      insects, whereas the Hox genes are organized in a single cluster in the beetle
      Tribolium castaneum, they are split into two separate groups in the flies
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. The significance of a split Hox
      cluster is unknown and has been observed in only one organism outside the
      Drosophila lineage: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We have cloned a
      majority of the Hox genes from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Diptera:
      Culicidae) and compared their genomic organization with that of Tribolium and
      Drosophila to determine if a split Hox cluster is found in dipterans aside from
      the Drosophilidae. We find that the Hox genes in Anopheles, as in Tribolium, are 
      organized in a single cluster that spans a genomic region of at least 700 kb.
      This finding suggests that, within the insect genome, the partition of the Hox
      cluster may have evolved exclusively within the Drosophila lineage. The genomic
      structures of the resident genes, however, appear to be largely conserved between
      A. gambiae and D. melanogaster.

TI  - [Some regularities in the genetic control of the stress reaction in Drosophila].
PG  - 73-80
AB  - The heat-shock response was studied in Drosophila virilis strains with normal and
      impaired neurohormonal stress reaction. Flies from the latter strain were shown
      to have the impaired heat-shock response. In this strain, transcription of the
      heat shock gene hsp83 is reduced and synthesis of all heat shock proteins is
      suppressed. The neurohormonal stress reaction (status of dopamine, octopamine,
      and juvenile hormone metabolic systems) was examined in D. melanogaster strains
      having normal and impaired heat-shock response. The impairment of this response
      did not prevent the development of the stress reaction: in flies of both strains,
      the stress exposure resulted in an increase in the dopamine content and in a
      decrease in the activity of tyrosine decarboxylase (the first enzyme of dopamine 
      synthesis) and in the level of juvenile hormone degradation. However, stress
      reactivity in mutant individuals differed from that in flies that did not carry
      stress-related mutations.

TI  - Ecdysteroids in stress responsive and nonresponsive Drosophila virilis lines
      under stress conditions.
PG  - 2657-62
AB  - After exposure to thermal stress or a control temperature, the relative abundance
      of ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) was measured in a wild-type line of 
      Drosophila virilis (101) that is stress responsive and in a mutant line (147)
      that is not stress responsive. In line 101, the 20E content was higher and E
      content lower in females than in males. The abundance of E and 20E in females of 
      line 147 was significantly higher than that in females of line 101. Females of
      line 101 were found to respond to 60 min of heat stress (38 degrees C) by an
      increase in the abundance of both E and 20E, while in males of this line the
      amount of 20E increased and that of E declined. A role of the ecdysteroids in the
      control of reproduction of D. virilis under stress is discussed.

TI  - Evolutionary conservation of the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein Gp150 
      in Drosophila and Bombyx.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - Gp150 is a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 
      superfamily. Here we report the molecular characterization of a Gp150 homolog in 
      Drosophila virilis, which is separated from Drosophila melanogaster by about 60
      million years. A silkworm Bombyx mori Gp150 homolog was identified through a
      sequence database search. Sequence analysis revealed high conservation in the
      LRRs and cysteine motifs flanking the LRR region in the extracellular domain of
      Gp150. Using an in vivo assay, we demonstrated that the extracellular domain is
      essential for Gp150 function. Moreover, structural features unique to the Gp150
      proteins were identified that include an incomplete carboxy-flanking cysteine
      motif, acidic regions on both sides of the LRR region in the extracellular
      domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain with three putative tyrosine
      phosphorylation motifs, which might be involved in interaction with SH2 domains. 
      Thus, Gp150 defines a new subfamily of LRR proteins and may be involved in signal
      transduction. Sequence comparison of the two Drosophila gp150 genes demonstrated 
      a high degree of conservation of genome organization downstream of the gp150
      gene. Interestingly, D. virilis gp150 coding region appears to have an additional
      intron, an uncommon feature in homologs of other genes. The expression pattern of
      gp150 during embryogenesis in D. melanogaster and D. virilis was found to be
      identical. gp150 transcripts were localized generally to regions where cells are 
      undergoing dramatic morphogenetic movements. This is further corroborated by the 
      localization of gp150 transcripts in eye imaginal discs in the region spanning
      the morphogenetic furrow.

TI  - DPKQDFMRFamide expression is similar in two distantly related Drosophila species.
PG  - 235-9
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster DPKQDFMRFamide was isolated and its expression reported. 
      Distribution of DPKQDFMRFamide immunoreactivity is now described in Drosophila
      virilis. DPKQDFMRFamide antibody stained a cell in the subesophageal ganglion in 
      embryo. DPKQDFMRFamide antibody stained cells in the superior protocerebrum,
      subesophageal ganglion, thoracic ganglia, and an abdominal ganglion in larva,
      pupa, and adult. DPKQDFMRFamide antibody stained an additional pair of cells in
      the optic lobe and a cell in the lateral protocerebrum in adult. Structure
      identity and similar distribution of DPKQDFMRFamide in D. virilis and D.
      melanogaster, two distantly related Drosophila species, suggests an important and
      conserved activity for the peptide.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the nonA region in Drosophila identifies a highly
      diverged 5' gene that may constrain nonA promoter evolution.
PG  - 751-64
AB  - A genomic fragment from Drosophila virilis that contained all the
      no-on-transientA (nonA) coding information, plus several kilobases of upstream
      material, was identified. Comparisons of nonA sequences and the gene nonA-like in
      D. melanogaster, a processed duplication of nonA, suggest that it arose before
      the split between D. melanogaster and D. virilis. In both species, another gene
      that lies <350 bp upstream from the nonA transcription starts, and that probably 
      corresponds to the lethal gene l(1)i19, was identified. This gene encodes a
      protein that shows similarities to GPI1, which is required for the biosynthesis
      of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a component for anchoring eukaryotic
      proteins to membranes, and so we have named it dGpi1. The molecular evolution of 
      nonA and dGpi1 sequences show remarkable differences, with the latter revealing a
      level of amino acid divergence that is as high as that of transformer and with
      extremely low levels of codon bias. Nevertheless, in D. melanogaster hosts, the
      D. virilis fragment rescues the lethality associated with a mutation of l(1)i19e,
      as well as the viability and visual defects produced by deletion of nonA(-). The 
      presence of dGpi1 sequences so close to nonA appears to have constrained the
      evolution of the nonA promoter.

TI  - A versatile vector set for animal transgenesis.
PG  - 630-7
AB  - Genetic manipulation of a series of diverged arthropods is a highly desirable
      goal for a better understanding of developmental and evolutionary processes. A
      major obstacle so far has been the difficulty in obtaining marker genes that
      allow easy and reliable identification of transgenic animals. Here, we present a 
      versatile vector set for germline transformation based on the promiscuous
      transposons mariner, Hermes and piggyBac. Into these vectors, we introduced a
      potentially universal marker system that is comprised of an artificial promoter
      containing three Pax-6 homodimer binding sites. This promoter drives strong
      expression of spectral variants of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 
      in larval, pupal, and adult photoreceptors. Using special filter sets, the yellow
      (EYFP) and cyan (ECFP) variant are fully distinguishable and therefore represent 
      a separable pair of markers. Furthermore, we adapted a simple plasmid-based
      transposition assay system to enable quick functional tests of our vectors in
      different arthropod species before employing them in more laborious germline
      transformation experiments. Using this system we demonstrate that our vectors
      transpose in both Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis.

TI  - Control of Drosophila paramyosin/miniparamyosin gene expression. Differential
      regulatory mechanisms for muscle-specific transcription.
PG  - 8278-87
AB  - To define the transcriptional mechanisms contributing to stage- and
      tissue-specific expression of muscle genes, we performed transgenic analysis of
      Drosophila paramyosin gene regulation. This gene has two promoters, one for
      paramyosin and one for miniparamyosin, which are active in partially overlapping 
      domains. Regions between -0.9 and -1.7 kilobases upstream of each initiation site
      contribute to the temporal and spatial expression patterns. By comparing the
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis promoters, conserved binding sites
      were found for known myogenic factors, including one MEF2 site and three E boxes.
      In contrast with previous data, our experiments with the paramyosin promoter
      indicate that the MEF2 site is essential but not sufficient for proper paramyosin
      gene transcription. Mutations in the three E boxes, on the other hand, do not
      produce any effect in embryonic/larval muscles. Thus MEF2 site- and E box-binding
      proteins can play different roles in the regulation of different muscle-specific 
      genes. For the miniparamyosin promoters, several conserved sequences were shown
      to correspond to functionally important regions. Our data further show that the
      two promoters work independently. Even when both promoters are active in the same
      muscle fiber, the transcription driven by one of the promoters is not affected by
      transcription driven by the other.

TI  - Genetic control of biogenic-amine systems in Drosophila under normal and stress
      conditions.
PG  - 167-80
AB  - The contents of octopamine and its precursors (tyrosine and tyramine) were
      studied in adults of two lines of Drosophila virilis with contrasting stress
      responses. It was demonstrated that in individuals responding to stress by a
      hormonal stress reaction (line 101), the contents of octopamine and tyrosine are 
      lower than in nonresponding flies (line 147). It was found that there is no
      difference between the lines in the level of tyramine under normal conditions.
      The dopamine response to stressor was also studied. Genetic analysis of these
      differences revealed that they are controlled by a single gene and that the gene 
      is not sex-linked. The gene controlling the response was found to be linked to
      chromosome 6 of D. virilis.

TI  - A telomeric satellite in Drosophila virilis and its sibling species.
PG  - 372-80
AB  - Telomere elongation by telomerase is the most widespread mechanism among
      eukaryotes. However, alternative mechanisms such as homologous recombination
      between terminal satellite DNAs are probably used in lower dipteran insects and
      in some plants. Drosophila melanogaster uses the very unusual telomere elongation
      pathway of transposition of telomere-specific retrotransposable elements. The
      uniqueness of this telomere elongation mechanism raises the question of its
      origin. We, therefore, analyzed sequences located at telomeres of fairly
      distantly related Drosophila species, and in this paper we describe the
      characterization of complex satellite DNA sequences located at the telomeres of
      D. virilis and other species in the virilis group. We suggest an involvement of
      these DNA satellites in telomere elongation by homologous recombination similar
      to that found in lower dipterans. Our findings raise the possibility that
      telomere elongation by specific retrotransposons as found in D. melanogaster and 
      its sibling species is a recent event in the evolution of dipteran insects.

TI  - Drosophila virilis has long and highly polymorphic microsatellites.
PG  - 1641-6
AB  - Comparative genomics is a powerful approach to inference of the dynamics of
      genome evolution. Most information about the evolution of microsatellites in the 
      genus Drosophila has been obtained from Drosophila melanogaster. For comparison, 
      we collected microsatellite data for the distantly related species Drosophila
      virilis. Screening about 0.5 Mb of nonredundant genomic sequence from GenBank, we
      identified 239 dinucleotide microsatellites. On average, D. virilis dinucleotides
      were significantly longer than D. melanogaster microsatellites (7.69 repeats vs. 
      6.75 repeats). Similarly, direct cloning of microsatellites resulted in a higher 
      mean repeat number in D. virilis than in D. melanogaster (12.7 repeats vs. 12.2
      repeats). Characterization of 11 microsatellite loci mapping to division 40-49 on
      the fourth chromosome of D. virilis indicated that D. virilis microsatellites are
      more variable than those of D. melanogaster.

TI  - [Genetic characteristics of the wing mutation Odd(22) and its interaction with
      alleles of the Delta locus in Drosophila virilis].
PG  - 1049-54
AB  - The dominant sex-linked semilethal mutation Odd22 was isolated from progeny of a 
      dysgenic cross of Drosophila virilis lines. Flies homozygous, heterozygous, and
      hemizygous for Odd22 displayed multiple wing defects, including enlargements and 
      gaps on the veins; irregularly thickened, branched, shortened, or completely
      reduced veins; and cuts on the wing margin. The most remarkable feature of the
      Odd22 expression was a combination of both an increase and a reduction of the
      wing vein material simultaneously present in the same wing, which is commonly
      associated with suppression and hyperfunction, respectively, of genes of the
      Notch (N) signaling system. Phenotypic analysis revealed the interaction of Odd22
      with alleles of the Delta (Dl) locus, which codes for the ligand of the NOTCH
      receptor. Based on these data, Odd22 was assumed to directly or indirectly affect
      the activity of the genes involved in Dl-N signaling.

TI  - The DNA replication-related element (DRE)-DRE-binding factor (DREF) system may be
      involved in the expression of the Drosophila melanogaster TBP gene.
PG  - 71-7
AB  - The TATA box binding protein (TBP) is a general transcription factor required for
      initiation by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. Previously, we found that the
      promoter region of the Drosophila melanogaster TBP gene contains three sequences 
      similar to the DNA replication-related element (DRE) (5'-TATCGATA). In the
      present study, we found that the DRE-like sequences are also present in the
      promoter of the Drosophila virilis TBP gene, suggesting a role for these
      sequences in TBP expression. Band mobility shift assays revealed that
      oligonucleotides containing sequences similar to the DRE of D. melanogaster TBP
      gene promoter form specific complexes with a factor in a Kc cell nuclear extract 
      and with recombinant DRE-binding factor (DREF). Furthermore, these complexes were
      either supershifted or diminished by monoclonal antibodies to DREF. Transient
      luciferase assays demonstrated that induction of mutations in two DRE-related
      sequences at positions -223 and -63 resulted in an extensive reduction of
      promoter activity. Thus, the DRE-DREF system appears to be involved in the
      expression of the D. melanogaster TBP gene.

TI  - Mobile elements and chromosomal evolution in the virilis group of Drosophila.
PG  - 11337-42
AB  - Species of the virilis group of Drosophila differ by multiple inversions and
      chromosome fusions that probably accompanied, or led to, speciation. Drosophila
      virilis has the primitive karyotype for the group, and natural populations are
      exceptional in having no chromosomal polymorphisms. We report that the genomic
      locations of Penelope and Ulysses transposons are nonrandomly distributed in 12
      strains of D. virilis. Furthermore, Penelope and Ulysses insertion sites in D.
      virilis show a statistically significant association with the breakpoints of
      inversions found in other species of the virilis group. Sixteen newly induced
      chromosomal rearrangements were isolated from the progeny of D. virilis hybrid
      dysgenic crosses, including 12 inversions, 2 translocations, and 2 deletions.
      Penelope and Ulysses were associated with the breakpoints of over half of these
      new rearrangements. Many rearrangement breakpoints also coincide with the
      chromosomal locations of Penelope and Ulysses insertions in the parental strains 
      and with breakpoints of inversions previously established for other species of
      the group. Analysis of homologous sequences from D. virilis and Drosophila lummei
      indicated that Penelope insertion sites were closely, but not identically,
      located at the nucleotide sequence level. Overall, these results indicate that
      Penelope and Ulysses insert in a limited number of genomic locations and are
      consistent with the possibility that these elements play an important role in the
      evolution of the virilis species group.

TI  - Invasion of Drosophila virilis by the Penelope transposable element.
PG  - 350-7
AB  - The Penelope family of transposable elements (TEs) is broadly distributed in most
      species of the virilis species group of Drosophila. This element plays a pivotal 
      role in hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis, in which at least four
      additional TE families are also activated. Here we present evidence that the
      Penelope family of elements has recently invaded D. virilis. This evidence
      includes: (1) a patchy geographical distribution, (2) genomic locations mainly
      restricted to euchromatic chromosome arms in various geographical strains, and
      (3) a high level of nucleotide similarity among members of the family. Two
      samples from a Tashkent (Middle Asia) population of D. virilis provide further
      support for the invasion hypothesis. The 1968 Tashkent strain is free of Penelope
      sequences, but all individuals collected from a 1997 population carry at least
      five Penelope copies. Furthermore, a second TE, Ulysses, has amplified and spread
      in this population. These results provide evidence for the Penelope invasion of a
      D. virilis natural population and the mobilization of unrelated resident
      transposons following the invasion.

TI  - Evidence for selection at the fused locus of Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 1701-9
AB  - The genomic DNA sequence of a 2.4-kb region of the X-linked developmental gene
      fused was determined in 15 Drosophila virilis strains. One common replacement
      polymorphism is observed, where a negatively charged aspartic amino acid is
      replaced by the noncharged amino acid alanine. This replacement variant is
      located within the serine/threonine kinase domain of the fused gene and is
      present in approximately 50% of the sequences in our sample. Significant linkage 
      disequilibrium is detected around this replacement site, although the fused gene 
      is located in a region of the D. virilis X chromosome that seems to experience
      normal levels of recombination. In a 600-bp region around the replacement site,
      all eight alanine sequences are identical; of the six aspartic acid sequences,
      three are also identical. The occurrence of little or no variation within the
      aspartic acid and alanine haplotypes, coupled with the presence of several
      differences between them, is very unlikely under the usual equilibrium neutral
      model. Our results suggest that the fused alanine haplotypes have recently
      increased in frequency in the D. virilis population.

AB  - Cellular stress response was investigated in two lines of D. virilis: wild type
      and line with disturbed neurohormonal stress-reaction. Analysis of proteins,
      synthesized in salivary glands of larvae of both lines under heat stress,
      revealed malfunction in heat shock reaction of mutant specimen. This malfunction 
      expresses in decreased level of heat shock protein synthesis. Analysis of
      electrophoretic spectra of proteins from homogenates of imagoes of both lines
      maintained under normal conditions and those exposed to heat (38 degrees C, 60
      min.) revealed correlation between protein spectrum and physiological state of
      the organism. Interlinear differences by proteins spectra in normal condition,
      controlled by a single gene (or by block of closely linked genes), were found.
      The question if there is a common genetic control for the neurohormonal
      stress-reaction and cellular stress response is discussed.

TI  - Origin and evolution of the regulatory gene male-specific lethal-3.
PG  - 1240-50
AB  - Dosage compensation in Drosophila is mediated by genes known as "male-specific
      lethals" (msls). Several msls, including male-specific lethal-3 (msl-3), encode
      proteins of unknown function. We cloned the Drosophila virilis msl-3 gene. Using 
      the information provided by the sequences of the Drosophila melanogaster and D.
      virilis genes, we found that sequences of other species can be aligned along
      their entire lengths with msl-3. Among them, there are genes in yeasts (the
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe Alp13 gene, as well as a putative Alp13 homolog, found 
      in Saccharomyces cerevisae) and in mammals (MRG15 and MSL3L1 and their relatives)
      plus uncharacterized sequences of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the
      plants Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Zea mays. A second
      Drosophila gene of this family has also been found. It is thus likely that
      msl-3-like genes are present in all eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest
      that msl-3 is orthologous to the mammalian MSL3L1 genes, while the second
      Drosophila melanogaster gene (which we have called Dm MRG15) is orthologous to
      mammalian MRG15. These analyses also suggest that the msl-3/MRG15 duplication
      occurred after the fungus/animal split, while an independent duplication occurred
      in plants. The proteins encoded by these genes have similar structures, including
      a putative chromodomain close to their N-terminal end and a putative leucine
      zipper at their C-terminus. The possible functional roles of these proteins are
      discussed.

TI  - Evolution of gypsy endogenous retrovirus in the Drosophila obscura species group.
PG  - 1185-93
AB  - The Ty3/gypsy family of retroelements is closely related to retroviruses, and
      some of their members have an open reading frame resembling the retroviral gene
      env. Sequences homologous to the gypsy element from Drosophila melanogaster are
      widely distributed among Drosophila species. In this work, we report a
      phylogenetic study based mainly on the analysis of the 5' region of the env gene 
      from several species of the obscura group, and also from sequences already
      reported of D. melanogaster, Drosophila virilis, and Drosophila hydei. Our
      results indicate that the gypsy elements from species of the obscura group
      constitute a monophyletic group which has strongly diverged from the prototypic
      D. melanogaster gypsy element. Phylogenetic relationships between gypsy sequences
      from the obscura group are consistent with those of their hosts, indicating
      vertical transmission. However, D. hydei and D. virilis gypsy sequences are
      closely related to those of the affinis subgroup, which could be indicative of
      horizontal transmission.

PG  - 927-35
AB  - DNA sequence studies of cytochrome b(5) (Cyt-b) genes from Drosophila
      melanogaster and Drosophila virilis predict that the Drosophila Cyt-b proteins
      are extremely hydrophobic and have at least eight potential transmembrane
      spanning domains. Primary protein sequence analysis also predicts that the Cyt-b 
      proteins have mitochondrial targeting sequences and they contain sites for
      potential post-translational modification similar to other cytochrome proteins.
      We report the characterization of the cytochrome b(5) proteins from Drosophila
      melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. We have used a Drosophila cytochrome b(5)
      specific antibody to demonstrate that cytochrome b(5) proteins are expressed in
      muscle-containing tissues in the fly. We also provide evidence that the nuclear
      encoded cytochrome b(5) protein that contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence 
      is translocated to mitochondria.

AB  - Females of two Drosophila virilis group species, D. virilis and D. montana, have 
      different requirements for the courting males. In the present study we have
      examined species differences in female receptivity and male courtship song
      requirement using females' acceptance signal instead of copulation for measuring 
      female readiness to mate. Behavior of D. virilis and D. montana females and F1
      and backcross hybrid females was observed in a single-pair courtships with D.
      virilis and D. montana males and normal and wingless (mute) F1 hybrid males. D.
      virilis females were very receptive and they commonly accepted the courtship of
      males unable to produce courtship song. D. montana females, on the contrary, had 
      a low receptivity and these females accepted the courting male only after hearing
      his song. Interspecific F1 and backcross (BCm) females resembled D. virilis more 
      than D. montana in their receptivity. These females, however, resembled D.
      montana in their song requirement. These findings suggest that female song
      requirement and female receptivity are determined by different genetic factors.

TI  - Localization of genes affecting species differences in male courtship song
      between Drosophila virilis and D. littoralis.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - The males of six species of the Drosophila virilis group (including D. virilis)
      keep their wings extended while producing a train of sound pulses, where the
      pulses follow each other without any pause. The males of the remaining five
      species of the group produce only one sound pulse during each wing
      extension/vibration, which results in species-specific songs with long pauses (in
      D. littoralis about 300 ms) between successive sound pulses. Genetic analyses of 
      the differences between the songs of D. virilis and D. littoralis showed that
      species-specific song traits are affected by genes on the X chromosome, and for
      the length of pause, also by genes on chromosomes 3 and 4. The X chromosomal
      genes having a major impact on pulse and pause length were tightly linked with
      white, apricot and notched marker genes located at the proximal third of the
      chromosome. A large inversion in D. littoralis, marked by notched, prevents more 
      precise localization of these genes by classical crossing methods.

TI  - Gregarious development in alysiine parasitoids evolved through a reduction in
      larval aggression.
PG  - 131-141
AB  - Population genetic models have suggested that siblicide between the larvae of
      parasitoid wasps, once gained, can be lost only under stringent conditions,
      making transitions from solitary to gregarious development rare. However,
      phylogenetic studies suggest that gregarious development has evolved on numerous 
      occasions, although the mechanisms are largely unknown. We report experiments, on
      two morphologically similar species of alysiine braconids, directed at an
      understanding of how gregarious development evolved in one subfamily. We compared
      the oviposition behaviour and development of Aphaereta genevensis and A. pallipes
      in the laboratory, on the host Drosophila virilis. Aphaereta genevensis usually
      lays a single egg in each host, and only a single wasp usually develops
      successfully even when several eggs are laid. However, A. pallipes often lays
      more than one egg in each host, and several offspring often complete development.
      Dissections of superparasitized hosts showed that this difference is accompanied 
      by differences in larval behaviour: first-instar A. genevensis use their sharp
      mandibles to kill other parasitoid eggs or larvae in the same host. First-instar 
      A. pallipes also have sharp mandibles, but do not attack conspecific larvae,
      suggesting that siblicide might have been lost by a simple change in larval
      behaviour. Aphaereta genevensis shows some features that may have helped select
      for reduction in larval aggression in the subfamily: a longer development time,
      multiple egg clutches and incomplete brood reduction. Aphaereta spp. show great
      promise as model systems for studying the evolution of siblicide. Copyright 1999

TI  - Gypsy group retrotransposon Tv1 from Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 193-9
AB  - We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the 6868 bp full-size
      retrotransposon termed 'Tv1'. Tv1 was isolated from the DNA fraction of
      extracellular virus-like particles of Drosophila virilis culture cells. Tv1 has
      the typical structure for a gypsy-group retrotransposon. The Tv1 element was
      found to be flanked by 453 bp long terminal direct repeats identical to each
      other. The central part of the element contains three long open reading frames
      which resemble the gag, pol and env genes of retroviruses. ORF2 includes
      conservative motifs of protease, reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase in 
      the order characteristic for the gypsy-group retrotransposons. Although most
      copies of Tv1 are located in pericentromeric heterochromatin, the amplification
      of this family demonstrated in the cell culture and site polymorphism observed in
      different Drosophila strains suggest functional activity of the Tv1 element.

TI  - X chromosome DNA variation in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 1905-12
AB  - Comparisons of polymorphism patterns between distantly related species are
      essential in order to determine their generality. However, most work on the genus
      Drosophila has been done only with species of the subgenus Sophophora. In the
      present work, we have sequenced one intron and surrounding coding sequences of 6 
      X-linked genes (chorion protein s36, elav, fused, runt, suppressor of sable and
      zeste) from 21 strains of wild-type Drosophila virilis (subgenus Drosophila).
      From these data, we have estimated the average level of DNA polymorphism,
      inferred the effective population size and population structure of this species, 
      and compared the results with those obtained for other Drosophila species. There 
      is no reduction in variation at two loci close to the centromeric
      heterochromatin, in contrast to Drosophila melanogaster.

TI  - The homeodomain transcription factor NK-4 acts as either a transcriptional
      activator or repressor and interacts with the p300 coactivator and the Groucho
      corepressor.
PG  - 31543-52
AB  - NK-4 (tinman) encodes an NK-2 class homeodomain transcription factor that is
      required for development of the Drosophila dorsal mesoderm, including heart.
      Genetic evidence suggests its important role in mesoderm subdivision, yet the
      properties of NK-4 as a transcriptional regulator and the mechanism of gene
      transcription by NK-4 are not completely understood. Here, we describe its
      properties as a transcription factor and its interaction with the p300
      coactivator and the Groucho corepressor. We demonstrate that NK-4 can activate or
      repress target genes in cultured cells, depending on functional domains that are 
      conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis NK-4 genes.
      Using GAL4-NK-4 fusion constructs, we have mapped a transcriptional activation
      domain (amino acids 1-110) and repression domains (amino acids 111-188 and the
      homeodomain) and found an inhibitory function for the homeodomain in
      transactivation by NK-4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NK-4-dependent
      transactivation is augmented by the p300 coactivator and show that NK-4
      physically interacts with p300 via the activation domain. In addition,
      cotransfection experiments indicate that the repressor activity of NK-4 is
      strongly enhanced by the Groucho corepressor. Using immunoprecipitation and in
      vitro pull-down assays, we show that NK-4 directly interacts with the Groucho
      corepressor, for which the homeodomain is required. Together, our results
      indicate that NK-4 can act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor and
      provide the first evidence of NK-4 interactions with the p300 coactivator and the
      Groucho corepressor.

TI  - Antisera against Periplaneta americana Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD):
      separation of the neurohormone bursicon from SOD, and immunodetection of SOD in
      the central nervous system.
PG  - 861-71
AB  - In an effort to characterize the insect molting hormone bursicon from the
      cockroach, Periplaneta americana, amino acid sequences with high identity of
      Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) of Drosophila virilis were identified. Antisera 
      against a conserved region of SOD, and a sequence unique to Periplaneta SOD were 
      produced and used to test whether bursicon might be a form of SOD. Western blots 
      of one- and two-dimensional gels revealed that the dimeric form of SOD and
      bursicon have a similar molecular mass (30 kDa). The two proteins can be
      separated, however, according to their different isoelectric points. Bursicon is 
      identified in two-dimensional gels by elution from four unique spots not labeled 
      by the anti-SOD antisera. In sections of Periplaneta nerve cords the antisera
      labeled glial material surrounding neuronal somata close to the neural sheath.
      Bursicon, however, is contained in unique cell pairs in the ganglia of the
      ventral nerve cord. These neurons were labeled with new antisera produced against
      novel sequences of one of the four above-mentioned bursicon active spots. The
      results show unequivocally that SOD and bursicon are distinctly different
      proteins. Furthermore, the anti-SOD antisera provided a tool to isolate and
      sequence bursicon.

TI  - Vertebrate homologs of Drosophila suppressor of fused interact with the gli
      family of transcriptional regulators.
PG  - 323-36
AB  - The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is crucial for pattern formation during
      metazoan development. Although originially characterized in Drosophila,
      vertebrate homologs have been identified for several, but not all, genes in the
      pathway. Analysis of mutants in Drosophila demonstrates that Suppressor of fused 
      [Su(fu)] interacts genetically with genes encoding proteins in the Hh signal
      transduction pathway, and its protein product physically interacts with two of
      the proteins in the Hh pathway. We report here the molecular cloning and
      characterization of chicken and mouse homologs of Su(fu). The chick and mouse
      proteins are 27% identical and 53% similar at the amino acid level to the
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis proteins. Vertebrate Su(fu) is
      widely expressed in the developing embryo with higher levels in tissues that are 
      known to be patterned by Hh signaling. The chick Su(fu) protein can physically
      interact with factors known to function in Hh signal transduction including the
      Drosophila serine/threonine kinase, Fused, and the vertebrate transcriptional
      regulators Gli1 and Gli3. This interaction may be significant for transcriptional
      regulation, as recombinant Su(fu) enhances the ability of Gli proteins to bind
      DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

AB  - The linkage group of genes controlling alkaline-phosphatase (AP) and
      tyrosine-decarboxylase (TDC) activities in Drosophila virilis adults was
      determined. D. virilis strain 160, with all autosomes marked with recessive
      morphological mutations, was used for the analysis. AP and TDC activities were
      significantly higher in strain 160 than in strain 147. The analysis of F2
      hybrids, which carried one chromosome (one or both homologues) of strain 147 and 
      the rest of strain 160, allowed the assignment of the genes controlling AP and
      TDC activities in D. virilis adults to chromosome 6.

TI  - Structure and evolution of a pair-rule interaction element: runt regulatory
      sequences in D. melanogaster and D. virilis.
PG  - 87-99
AB  - Pair-rule genes serve two important functions during Drosophila development: they
      first initiate periodic patterns, and subsequently interact with each other to
      refine these patterns to the precision required for definition of segmental
      compartments. Previously, we described a pair-rule input region of the runt gene.
      Here we further characterize this region through the use of reporter gene
      constructs and by comparison with corresponding sequences from Drosophila
      virilis. We find that many but not all regulatory properties of this '7-stripe
      region' are functionally conserved. Moreover, the similarity between these
      homologous sequences is surprisingly low. When compared to similar data for gap
      gene input element, our data suggest that pair-rule target sequences are less
      constrained during evolution, and that functional elements mediating pair-rule
      interactions can be dispersed over many kilobases.

TI  - High sequence turnover in the regulatory regions of the developmental gene
      hunchback in insects.
PG  - 253-65
AB  - Extensive sequence analysis of the developmental gene hunchback and its 5' and 3'
      regulatory regions in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila virilis, Musca
      domestica, and Tribolium castaneum, using a variety of computer algorithms,
      reveals regions of high sequence simplicity probably generated by slippage-like
      mechanisms of turnover. No regions are entirely refractory to the action of
      slippage, although the density and composition of simple sequence motifs varies
      from region to region. Interestingly, the 5' and 3' flanking regions share short 
      repetitive motifs despite their separation by the gene itself, and the motifs are
      different in composition from those in the exons and introns. Furthermore, there 
      are high levels of conservation of motifs in equivalent orthologous regions.
      Detailed sequence analysis of the P2 promoter and DNA footprinting assays reveal 
      that the number, orientation, sequence, spacing, and protein-binding affinities
      of the BICOID-binding sites varies between species and that the 'P2' promoter,
      the nanos response element in the 3' untranslated region, and several conserved
      boxes of sequence in the gene (e.g., the two zinc-finger regions) are surrounded 
      by cryptically-simple-sequence DNA. We argue that high sequence turnover and
      genetic redundancy permit both the general maintenance of promoter functions
      through the establishment of coevolutionary (compensatory) changes in cis- and
      trans-acting genetic elements and, at the same time, the possibility of subtle
      changes in the regulation of hunchback in the different species.

TI  - Patterns of nucleotide substitution in Drosophila and mammalian genomes.
PG  - 1475-9
AB  - To estimate patterns of molecular evolution of unconstrained DNA sequences, we
      used maximum parsimony to separate phylogenetic trees of a non-long terminal
      repeat retrotransposable element into either internal branches, representing
      mainly the constrained evolution of active lineages, or into terminal branches,
      representing mainly nonfunctional "dead-on-arrival" copies that are unconstrained
      by selection and evolve as pseudogenes. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions
      in unconstrained sequences is expected to be congruent with the pattern of point 
      mutation. We examined the retrotransposon Helena in the Drosophila virilis
      species group (subgenus Drosophila) and the Drosophila melanogaster species
      subgroup (subgenus Sophophora). The patterns of point mutation are
      indistinguishable, suggesting considerable stability over evolutionary time
      (40-60 million years). The relative frequencies of different point mutations are 
      unequal, but the "transition bias" results largely from an approximately 2-fold
      excess of G.C to A.T substitutions. Spontaneous mutation is biased toward A.T
      base pairs, with an expected mutational equilibrium of approximately 65% A + T
      (quite similar to that of long introns). These data also enable the first
      detailed comparison of patterns of point mutations in Drosophila and mammals.
      Although the patterns are different, all of the statistical significance comes
      from a much greater rate of G.C to A.T substitution in mammals, probably because 
      of methylated cytosine "hotspots." When the G.C to A.T substitutions are
      discounted, the remaining differences are considerably reduced and not
      statistically significant.

PG  - 277-81
AB  - During the course of single cell olfactory recordings from the funicular part of 
      the antenna of Drosophila virilis we encountered a pair of cells firing
      synchronously and consistently at a rate of about 9 to 14 spikes per second.
      Every spike was seen to consist of a spike complex made up of two separate
      biphasic components thought to originate from two separate cells. The larger
      action potential, appearing first, had a peak-to-peak (ptp) amplitude of up to
      200 microV followed closely by a smaller spike with an amplitude of about 60
      microV. The repetitive firing pattern was not affected by air or odour puffs.
      This kind of consistent spontaneous spiking activity of two closely associated
      cells resembles remarkably closely the clock-spikes hitherto known only from the 
      eyes of flies. Our encounter with such cells in a sense organ other than the eye 
      poses many new questions and could lead to a renewed effort to understand the
      role(s) of the clock-spiking cells as possible oscillatory components of the
      dipteran pacemaking system in particular and the insect nervous systems,
      generally.

TI  - Variation and consistency of female preferences for simulated courtship songs in 
      Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 619-625
AB  - To study the variation and consistency of song preferences in Drosophila virilis 
      females, we played them species-specific song and songs with modified sound
      pulses and/or interpulse intervals on 3 consecutive days. Species-specific song
      was played again on the fourth day. All playbacks were done without the presence 
      of males. About 62% of the females indicated their readiness to mate by spreading
      their wings in at least one of the trials. The proportion of the females
      responding to species-specific song was about twice that of the females
      responding to modified songs. The majority of females responded to only one song 
      type, which suggests that the females varied in their preferences and that their 
      preference windows were rather narrow. The females were consistent in their
      responsiveness to species-specific song played on 2 days. If the female responded
      to normal song during the first trial, the probability of her responding to the
      same song during the second trial increased by about 32%. The number of songs
      required by the females before responding in the two subsequent trials was also
      correlated within the females (repeatability 0.328). Repeatability of female
      preferences for male sexual traits is expected both in the viability and
      Fisherian models of sexual selection. Copyright 1999 The Association for the

TI  - Drosophila virilis has atypical kinds and arrangements of histone repeats.
PG  - 529-39
AB  - Genomic and P1 clone DNAs of Drosophila virilis were analyzed to determine the
      structure and organization of histone genes in this species. The species contains
      unique and variable repeat types, in comparison with the related species
      Drosophila melanogaster, with quartet repeats lacking the H1 gene and
      multi-length variant quintet repeats containing the H1 gene. Unexpectedly, the
      H1-containing repeats are highly polymorphic in length, and thus not in a strict 
      tandem arrangement, while the H1-less repeats are very uniform and tandemly
      reiterated. Despite such differences, the relative positions and transcriptional 
      polarities of the histone gene subtypes of one subcloned quintet are similar to
      the major histone repeat type of D. melanogaster. For the first time, the histone
      H1 gene has been shown to be associated with other histone gene subtypes and is
      present at both chromosomal loci. DNA sequence variants of the H1 gene have been 
      mapped to individual P1 clones and found to be in a partitioned organization. The
      P1 cloning system has proved useful in completely retrieving a complex repetitive
      locus in vitro and in examining the structure and organization of the histone
      genes of D. virilis.

TI  - The formation of the functional chorion structure of Drosophila virilis involves 
      inercalation of the "middle" and "late" major chorion proteins: a general model
      for chorion assembly in Drosophilidae.
PG  - 97-110
AB  - We have shown by in vitro development of staged follicles in the presence of
      tritiated proline, as well as by immunoblot analysis, that the Dvs19 and DVS15
      chorion proteins of Drosophila virilis are synthesized by the follicular
      epithelium and are incorporated in the chorion at the terminal stages of
      choriogenesis. Light microscopy immunolocalization has revealed that these two
      proteins represent structural components of the endochorion in all the
      specialized regions of the eggshell, while, contrary to their temporal pattern of
      secretion, electron microscopic immunolocalization has shown that these two
      proteins participate in endochorionic structures formed before the onset of their
      synthesis, thus suggesting an intercalation process during chorion formation.
      Furthermore, double immunolocalizations demonstrated that cosecreted proteins do 
      not coexist in all secretory vesicles of the follicle cells, indicating that
      probably the final association of these chorionic components occurs
      extracellularly. On the basis of these data and those presented in the
      accompanying paper [Trougakos, I.P., and Margaritis, L.H. (1998)
      Immunolocalization of the temporally "early" secreted major structural chorion
      proteins, Dvs38 and Dvs36, in the eggshell layers and regions of Drosophila
      virilis, J. Struct. Biol. 123, 000-000.], a model for chorion assembly in
      Drosophilidae is proposed.

TI  - The Y chromosomes of Drosophila lummei and D. novamexicana differ in fertility
      factors.
PG  - 505-13
AB  - Many first-generation interspecific hybrids between the five species of the
      Drosophila virilis subgroup are fertile. Fertile hybrids can be utilized in the
      analysis of sterile hybrids, by creating new combinations of genetic elements to 
      identify cross-incompatible chromosomes or chromosome segments. Here, crosses
      starting from D. lummei, D. virilis, D. novamexicana and D. americana were
      produced to analyse the 96.4% male sterility in the progeny of D. virilis females
      mated with D. novamexicana males (sterility based on sperm motility). In
      autosomally identical heterozygous combination, the substitution of a large
      segment of the D. virilis X chromosome with a double or a triple inversion from
      the sister taxa decreased male sterility from 96.4% (Xvirilis) to 11%
      (Xvirilis/novamexicana), 19% (Xvirilis/americana) and 34% (Xvirilis/lummei). This
      result shows that the Xvirilis interaction with D. novamexicana elements (Y
      and/or autosomes) is a major component in the F1 sterility observed. When males
      with a substituted Ylummei in otherwise pure D. novamexicana were crossed with D.
      virilis females, all the F1 males were fertile. We constructed combinations of
      intact Xvirilis, recombinant Xvirilis/novamexicana, Ynovamexicana and Ylummei
      chromosomes in homozygous D. virilis and heterozygous D. virilis/D. novamexicana 
      autosomal backgrounds. In such combinations, the Y chromosome interacted strongly
      not only with the nonconspecific X chromosome, but with several autosomes.
      Autosomal hybrid sterility contributions tend to be recessive and not present in 
      the F1. In this species group, the role of the Y chromosome is central in
      contributing to the phenomenon called Haldane's rule of sterility, but the Y
      chromosomal incompatibility factor of D. novamexicana is the most divergent one.

TI  - [The Delta locus in Drosophila virilis: alleles, wing phenotypes and genetic
      interactions].
PG  - 22-34
AB  - A considerable number of Delta (D1) alleles resulting from spontaneous mutation
      or induced by following X-ray irradiation have been isolated on the basis of the 
      dominant phenotype consisting of disrupted wing venation and associated with
      heterozygosity for different D1 alleles. The L2 "delta" forming at the wing
      margin is the most characteristic fully penetrant phenotype of D1-heterozygous
      adults. The structure disruption of all other longitudinal (L3-L5) and cross (C1 
      and C2) veins including formation of "deltas" and other additional vein material,
      have been characterized as the irregular bilaterally asymmetrical nondirectional 
      fluctuations of D1 phenotype expression. The phenotypic interactions between
      Delta and two D1 phenotype enhancer mutations, L2 fork and gap L2, have been
      found. Possible participation of Delta, one of the elements of Notch signaling
      system, in the structure formation is discussed.

TI  - Identification of three conserved regions in the DREF transcription factors from 
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 510-6
AB  - The genes for a DNA replication-related element-binding factor (DREF) were
      isolated from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis, and their
      nucleotide sequences were determined. Drosophila virilis DREF consists of 742
      amino acid residues, which is 33 amino acids longer than D.melanogaster DREF.
      Comparison of the amino acid sequences revealed that D.virilis DREF is 71%
      identical to its D. melanogaster homolog. Three highly conserved regions were
      identified at amino acid positions 14-182 (CR1), 432-568 (CR2) and 636-730 (CR3) 
      of the D.virilis DREF, with 86.4, 86.1 and 83.3% identities, respectively.
      Transgenic flies in which expression of three conserved regions of D.melanogaster
      DREF was targeted to the eye imaginal disc were established. Expression of CR1 in
      the developing eye imaginal discs resulted in a severe rough eye phenotype in
      adult flies. Expression of CR3 also caused a rough eye phenotype, while that of
      CR2 had no apparent effect on eye morphology. Expression of either CR1 or CR3 in 
      eye imaginal disc cells inhibited cell cycle progression and reduced
      incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine into the S-phase zone (the second
      mitotic wave) behind the morphogenetic furrow. The results indicate that both CR1
      and CR3 are important for DREF functions.

TI  - Immunolocalization of the temporally "early" secreted major structural chorion
      proteins, Dvs38 and Dvs36, in the eggshell layers and regions of Drosophila
      virilis.
PG  - 111-23
AB  - We have shown by means of conventional electron microscopy that the eggshell of
      Drosophila virilis at the main body of the laid egg consists of the vitelline
      membrane and the multilayered chorion, which includes the wax layer, the
      innermost chorionic layer, the endochorion, and the exochorion, while several
      specialized regions of the eggshell are seen across the anterior-posterior axis
      of the egg. Biochemical analysis revealed the existence of six quantitatively
      enriched chorion proteins. Among them, Dvs38 and Dvs36 are synthesized when the
      innermost chorionic layer and the endochorion are assembled. Immunogold electron 
      microscopy has shown that these two proteins are incorporated in the
      morphologically complete vitelline membrane apparently through an intercalation
      process and represent structural components of the endochorion in all the
      specialized regions of the eggshell. Additionally, by cytochemical means, the
      enzyme eggshell peroxidase, which is synthesized in parallel with Dvs38 and
      Dvs36, has been identified as a structural component of the innermost chorionic
      layer and the endochorion. These findings suggest a complex protein-protein
      recognition pattern during the formation of the eggshell since the cosecretion of
      its components (i.e., Dvs38, Dvs36 chorion proteins and eggshell peroxidase) does
      not recommend their colocalization in the eggshell sublayers and the timing of
      their synthesis is not related to their final position on the eggshell (i.e., the
      identification of Dvs38 and Dvs36 chorion proteins as vitelline membrane
      components).

TI  - Autoregulation at the level of mRNA 3' end formation of the suppressor of forked 
      gene of Drosophila melanogaster is conserved in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 14302-7
AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster Suppressor of forked [Su(f)] protein shares homology 
      with the yeast RNA14 protein and the 77-kDa subunit of human cleavage stimulation
      factor, which are proteins involved in mRNA 3' end formation. This suggests a
      role for Su(f) in mRNA 3' end formation in Drosophila. The su(f) gene produces
      three transcripts; two of them are polyadenylated at the end of the transcription
      unit, and one is a truncated transcript, polyadenylated in intron 4. Using
      temperature-sensitive su(f) mutants, we show that accumulation of the truncated
      transcript requires wild-type Su(f) protein. This suggests that the Su(f) protein
      autoregulates negatively its accumulation by stimulating 3' end formation of the 
      truncated su(f) RNA. Cloning of su(f) from Drosophila virilis and analysis of its
      RNA profile suggest that su(f) autoregulation is conserved in this species.
      Sequence comparison between su(f) from both species allows us to point out three 
      conserved regions in intron 4 downstream of the truncated RNA poly(A) site. These
      conserved regions include the GU-rich downstream sequence involved in poly(A)
      site definition. Using transgenes truncated within intron 4, we show that
      sequence up to the conserved GU-rich domain is sufficient for production of the
      truncated RNA and for regulation of this production by su(f). Our results
      indicate a role of su(f) in the regulation of poly(A) site utilization and an
      important role of the GU-rich sequence for this regulation to occur.

TI  - Comparison of the GAGA factor genes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila
      virilis reveals high conservation of GAGA factor structure beyond the BTB/POZ and
      DNA-binding domains.
PG  - 447-56
AB  - As a member of the trithorax-group, the Trithorax-like (Trl) gene of Drosophila
      melanogaster contributes to the expression of homeotic genes and many other
      genes. Trl encodes different isoforms of the GAGA factor which is thought to act 
      as an "antirepressor" of transcription by remodelling chromatin structure and
      thereby rendering control regions accessible for transcriptional activators. A
      more global role of the GAGA factor in chromatin structure and function is
      suggested by various phenotypes of Trl mutations, such as modification of
      position effect variegation. To better define the molecular basis of these
      pleiotropic effects, we cloned cDNAs encoding the GAGA isoforms of D.
      melanogaster and a distantly related species, D. virilis. We also characterized
      the genomic organization of both the D. melanogaster and D. virilis genes, and
      analysed the expression patterns of isoform-specific mRNAs. The D. virilis GAGA
      isoforms show high similarity to their D. melanogaster counterparts, particularly
      within the BTB/POZ protein-interaction and the zinc finger DNA-binding domains.
      Interestingly, conservation clearly extends beyond the previously defined limits 
      of these domains. Moreover, the comparison reveals a completely conserved block
      of amino acid residues located between the BTB/POZ and DNA-binding domains, and a
      high conservation of the C-terminus specific for one of the GAGA isoforms. Thus, 
      sequences of as yet unknown functions are defined as rewarding targets for
      further mutational analyses. The high conservation of the GAGA proteins of the
      two species is in accord with the nearly identical genomic organization and
      expression patterns of the corresponding genes.

TI  - Conservation of read-through transcription of the Drosophila serendipity genes
      during evolution is gratuitous.
PG  - 484-90
AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster serendipity (sry) genes sry alpha and sry beta, which
      code for unrelated proteins and functions, are transcribed both as monocistronic 
      (sry alpha, srv beta) and dicistronic (sry beta-sry alpha) polyadenylated
      transcripts, the three types of transcripts being differentially expressed
      throughout development. We show here that, while the sry gene cluster is
      conserved in two other distantly related Drosophila species, sry beta-sry alpha
      dicistronic transcription is observed in one of them, Drosophila pseudoobscura
      but not in the other, Drosophila virilis, indicating that this mode of
      transcription is not subject to selection during evolution. Sequence comparison
      of the intergenic sry beta-sry alpha region suggests that sry, beta-sry alpha
      read-through transcription results from interference between initiation of
      transcription at the sry alpha promoter and 3' processing of the upstream sry
      beta transcript. From these and previous analyses, we propose that read-through
      transcription at the sry locus reflects its clustered gene organisation but is
      functionally gratuitous. This conclusion is supported by the autonomous rate of
      evolutionary sequence divergence shown by each individual sry gene.

TI  - Complex formation by the Drosophila MSL proteins: role of the MSL2 RING finger in
      protein complex assembly.
PG  - 5409-17
AB  - Drosophila MSL proteins are thought to act within a complex to elevate
      transcription from the male X chromosome. We found that the MSL1, MSL2 and MSL3
      proteins are associated in immunoprecipitations, chromatographic steps and in the
      yeast two-hybrid system, but that the MLE protein is not tightly complexed in
      these assays. We focused our analysis on the MSL2-MSL1 interaction, which is
      postulated to play a critical role in MSL complex association with the X
      chromosome. Using a modified two-hybrid assay, we isolated missense mutations in 
      MSL2 that disrupt its interaction with MSL1. Eleven out of 12 mutated residues
      clustered around the first zinc-binding site of the RING finger domain were
      conserved in a Drosophila virilis MSL2 homolog. Two pre-existing msl2 alleles,
      which fail to support male viability in vivo, have lesions in the same region of 
      the RING finger. We tested these in the two-hybrid system and found that they are
      also defective in interaction with MSL1. Mutation of the second zinc-binding site
      had little effect on MSL1 binding, suggesting that this portion of the RING
      finger may have a distinct function. Our data support a model in which MSL2-MSL1 
      interaction nucleates assembly of an MSL complex, with which MLE is weakly or
      transiently associated.

PG  - 625-8
AB  - Chromosome localization of the gene controlling the stress response of
      DFP-sensitive juvenile hormone (JH) esterase in females of Drosophila virilis was
      conducted. Line 160 of D. virilis carrying recessive markers on all chromosomes
      was used as a tester. Mature females of line 160 were shown to exhibit a high
      level of JH hydrolysis; these flies responded to stress by a sharp decrease in JH
      hydrolysis. Flies from line 147 lacked this response. Thus, mature females of
      lines 160 and 147 had different levels of JH hydrolysis under heat stress. F2
      hybrids that inherited one chromosome pair from flies of line 147 and the
      remaining chromosomes, from flies of line 147 were analyzed. This analysis showed
      that the D. virilis gene controlling the stress response of the JH degradation
      system is linked with chromosome 6.

TI  - Factors contributing to the hybrid dysgenesis syndrome in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 109-17
AB  - A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome in Drosophila virilis is associated with the
      mobilization of at least four unrelated transposable elements designated Helena, 
      Paris, Penelope and Ulysses. We carried out 42 crosses between eight strains
      differing in transposable element copy number in order to assess their
      contributions to hybrid dysgenesis. Linear regression and stepwise regression
      analysis was performed to estimate the correlation between the difference in
      euchromatic transposable element number between the parental flies of different
      strains involved in the crosses and the percentage, in the progeny of these
      crosses, of males with atrophic gonads. Male gonadal atrophy is a typical
      manifestation of the D. virilis hybrid dysgenesis syndrome. About half the
      variability in the level of male gonadal atrophy can be attributed to Penelope
      and Paris/Helena. Other factors also seem to play a significant role in hybrid
      dysgenesis in D. virilis, including maternally transmitted host factors and/or
      uncontrolled environmental variation. In the course of this work a novel
      transposable element named Telemac was found. Telemac is also mobilized in hybrid
      dysgenesis but does not appear to play a major causative role.

TI  - Expression of wingless in the Drosophila embryo: a conserved cis-acting element
      lacking conserved Ci-binding sites is required for patched-mediated repression.
PG  - 1469-76
AB  - Patterning of the Drosophila embryo depends on the accurate expression of
      wingless (wg), which encodes a secreted signal required for segmentation and many
      other processes. Early expression of wg is regulated by the nuclear proteins of
      the gap and pair-rule gene classes but, after gastrulation, wg transcription is
      also dependent on cell-cell communication. Signaling to the Wg-producing cells is
      mediated by the secreted protein, Hedgehog (Hh), and by Cubitus interruptus (Ci),
      a transcriptional effector of the Hh signal transduction pathway. The
      transmembrane protein Patched (Ptc) acts as a negative regulator of wg
      expression; ptc- embryos have ectopic wg expression. According to the current
      models, Ptc is a receptor for Hh. The default activity of Ptc is to inhibit Ci
      function; when Ptc binds Hh, this inhibition is released and Ci can control wg
      transcription. We have investigated cis-acting sequences that regulate wg during 
      the time that wg expression depends on Hh signaling. We show that approximately
      4.5 kb immediately upstream of the wg transcription unit can direct expression of
      the reporter gene lacZ in domains similar to the normal wg pattern in the
      embryonic ectoderm. Expression of this reporter construct expands in ptc mutants 
      and responds to hh activity. Within this 4.5 kb, a 150 bp element, highly
      conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis, is required to
      spatially restrict wg transcription. Activity of this element depends on ptc, but
      it contains no consensus Ci-binding sites. The discovery of an element that is
      likely to bind a transcriptional repressor was unexpected, since the prevailing
      model suggests that wg expression is principally controlled by Hh signaling
      acting through the Ci activator. We show that wg regulatory DNA can drive lacZ in
      a proper wg-like pattern without any conserved Ci-binding sites and suggest that 
      Ci can not be the sole endpoint of the Hh pathway.

TI  - Metabolic evolution in alpha-amylases from Drosophila virilis and D. repleta, two
      species with different ecological niches.
PG  - 407-12
AB  - alpha-Amylases from Drosophila virilis and D. repleta were partially purified by 
      ion exchange chromatography. The two amylases share common characteristics for pH
      and cations effects, although with slight differences. D. virilis has optimal
      activity at pH 6.6 and D. repleta at pH 7.2. Calcium, sodium, and potassium
      cations activate amylolytic activity in both species but Ba2+ has an activation
      effect in D. repleta only. In contrast, there are major differences in thermal
      offbility and kinetics among amylases of the two species. D. virilis amylase is
      much more stable at high temperature and the optimal temperatures are very
      different between the two species, respectively, 45 degrees C and 30 degrees C
      for D. virilis and D. repleta. alpha-Amylase activity using different substrates 
      is greater on starch than on glycogen in both species and still higher on amylose
      for D. virilis, the nonfungus feeder species. alpha-Amylase of D. repleta, the
      mycophagous species, has a better affinity to amylopectin and glycogen. Such
      differences in substrate specificity suggest adaptation to different resources in
      these species living in different habitats. Metabolic evolution seems to have
      occurred through a "tradeoff" between kinetic effectiveness and the nature of
      substrate, with a higher Vmax on amylose for D. virilis and a lower K(m) on
      glycogen for D. repleta.

PG  - 571-3
AB  - The locus BR-C, responsible for cell reaction to the hormone ecdysterone in
      Drosophila virilis, was previously cloned and mapped. This locus occupies a
      region of about 100 kb. To define exon location and a mode of D. virilis BR-C
      expression at different stages of development (embryos; first, second, and third 
      instar; early, middle and late pupae; adult flies), Northern blot hybridization
      was conducted. Poly(A)+ RNA, isolated from D. virilis flies at these
      developmental stages, was hybridized with fragments of the BR-C locus DNA. This
      D. virilis gene was shown to encode at least six different transcripts that were 
      10, 5.5, 4.4, 3.8, 3.3, and 2.7 kb in size. The highest gene expression is
      attained at the second and third instar and at the late pupa stage.

AB  - In 1980, Belyaeva et al. found in Drosophila melanogaster the ecs (ecdysterone
      sensitivity) locus, later designated BR-C (Broad-Complex). This locus plays a key
      role in the reaction cascade of ecdysterone-regulated development. The gene BR-C 
      was cloned by Chao and Guild (1986) and Belyaeva et al. (1987). To conduct
      "walking along the chromosome" in Drosophila virilis, cloned sequences of the
      BR-C gene from D. melanogaster were used as probes, hybridizing the start sites. 
      A fragment of about 100 kb containing BR-C of D. virilis was cloned. A
      restriction map of the cloned region was created.

TI  - High rate of DNA loss in the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis
      species groups.
PG  - 293-302
AB  - We recently proposed that patterns of evolution of non-LTR retrotransposable
      elements can be used to study patterns of spontaneous mutation. Transposition of 
      non-LTR retrotransposable elements commonly results in creation of 5' truncated, 
      "dead-on-arrival" copies. These inactive copies are effectively pseudogenes and, 
      according to the neutral theory, their molecular evolution ought to reflect rates
      and patterns of spontaneous mutation. Maximum parsimony can be used to separate
      the evolution of active lineages of a non-LTR element from the fate of the
      "dead-on-arrival" insertions and to directly assess the relative frequencies of
      different types of spontaneous mutations. We applied this approach using a
      non-LTR element, Helena, in the Drosophila virilis group and have demonstrated a 
      surprisingly high incidence of large deletions and the virtual absence of
      insertions. Based on these results, we suggested that Drosophila in general may
      exhibit a high rate of spontaneous large deletions and have hypothesized that
      such a high rate of DNA loss may help to explain the puzzling dearth of bona fide
      pseudogenes in Drosophila. We also speculated that variation in the rate of
      spontaneous deletion may contribute to the divergence of genome size in different
      taxa by affecting the amount of superfluous "junk" DNA such as, for example,
      pseudogenes or long introns. In this paper, we extend our analysis to the D.
      melanogaster subgroup, which last shared a common ancestor with the D. virilis
      group approximately 40 MYA. In a different region of the same transposable
      element, Helena, we demonstrate that inactive copies accumulate deletions in
      species of the D. melanogaster subgroup at a rate very similar to that of the D. 
      virilis group. These results strongly suggest that the high rate of DNA loss is a
      general feature of Drosophila and not a peculiar property of a particular stretch
      of DNA in a particular species group.

TI  - Conserved regions of the timeless (tim) clock gene in Drosophila analyzed through
      phylogenetic and functional studies.
PG  - 815-25
AB  - Circadian (approximately 24-hr) rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster depend upon
      cyclic expression of the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes, which encode
      interacting components of the endogenous clock. The per gene has been isolated
      from other insects and, more recently, a per ortholog was found in mammals where 
      its expression oscillates in a circadian fashion. We report here the complete
      sequence of a tim gene from another species, Drosophila virilis. TIM is better
      conserved than the PER protein is between these two species (76 vs. 54% overall
      amino acid identity), and putative functional domains, such as the PER
      interaction domains and the nuclear localization signal, are highly conserved.
      The acidic domain and the cytoplasmic localization domain, however, are within
      the least conserved regions. In addition, the initiating methionine in the D.
      virilis gene lies downstream of the proposed translation start for the original
      D. melanogaster tim cDNA and corresponds to the one used by D. simulans and D.
      yakuba. Among the most conserved parts of TIM is a region of unknown function
      near the N terminus. We show here that deletion of a 32 amino acid segment within
      this region affects rescue of rhythms in arrhythmic tim01 flies. Flies carrying a
      full-length tim transgene displayed rhythms with approximately 24-hr periods,
      indicating that a fully functional clock can be restored in tim01 flies through
      expression of a tim transgene. Deletion of the segment mentioned above resulted
      in very long activity rhythms with periods ranging from 30.5 to 48 hr.

TI  - The pore-forming and cytoplasmic domains of the neurogenic gene product, BIG
      BRAIN, are conserved between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - The Drosophila BIG BRAIN (BIB) protein functions critically in the determination 
      of neuroblasts in the embryonic ectoderm and many other cell types. BIB is a
      member of the MIP family of transmembrane channel proteins. The conserved channel
      domain of BIB is flanked by amino- and carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domains of
      unique sequence, which comprise over two-thirds of the protein. To determine
      whether the cytoplasmic domains of BIB are important for BIB function, we have
      cloned and sequenced the bib gene of D. virilis and compared it with that of D.
      melanogaster. Here we report that the channel domain and both cytoplasmic domains
      are highly conserved between the two species. The conservation of the cytoplasmic
      domains indicates that they are critical to BIB function. bib transcripts are

TI  - Trash DNA is what gets thrown away: high rate of DNA loss in Drosophila.
PG  - 279-89
AB  - We have recently described a novel method of estimating neutral rates and
      patterns of spontaneous mutation (Petrov et al., 1996). This method takes
      advantage of the propensity of non-LTR retrotransposable elements to create
      non-functional, 'dead-on-arrival' copies as a product of transposition. Maximum
      parsimony analysis is used to separate the evolution of actively transposing
      lineages of a non-LTR element from the fate of individual inactive insertions,
      and thereby allows one to assess directly the relative rates of different types
      of mutation, including point substitutions, deletions and insertions. Because
      non-LTR elements enjoy wide phylogenetic distribution, this method can be used in
      taxa that do not harbor a significant number of bona fide pseudogenes, as is the 
      case in Drosophila (Jeffs and Ashburner, 1991; Weiner et al., 1986). We used this
      method with Helena, a non-LTR retrotransposable element present in the Drosophila
      virilis species group. A striking finding was the virtual absence of insertions
      and remarkably high incidence of large deletions, which combine to produce a high
      overall rate of DNA loss. On average, the rate of DNA loss in D. virilis is
      approximately 75 times faster than that estimated for mammalian pseudogenes
      (Petrov et al., 1996). The high rate of DNA loss should lead to rapid elimination
      of non-essential DNA and thus may explain the seemingly paradoxical dearth of
      pseudogenes in Drosophila. Varying rates of DNA loss may also contribute to
      differences in genome size (Graur et al., 1989; Petrov et al., 1996), thus
      explaining the celebrated 'C-value' paradox (John and Miklos, 1988). In this
      paper we outline the theoretical basis of our method, examine the data from this 
      perspective, and discuss potential problems that may bias our estimates.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila homeotic gene teashirt by the
      homeodomain protein Fushi tarazu.
PG  - 157-72
AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster gene teashirt (tsh) is essential for segment identity
      of the embryonic thorax and abdomen. A deletion 3' to the tsh transcription unit 
      causes the loss of tsh early expression in the even-numbered parasegments, and
      the corresponding larval cuticular patterns are disrupted. tsh function in the
      odd-numbered parasegments in these mutants is normal by both criteria. The in
      vivo activities of genomic fragments from the deleted region were tested in
      transgenic embryos. A 2.0 kb enhancer from the 3' region acts mainly in the
      even-numbered parasegments and is dependent on fushi tarazu (ftz) activity, which
      encodes a homeodomain protein required for the development of even-numbered
      parasegments. Ftz protein binds in vitro to four distinct sequences in a 220 bp
      sub-fragment; these and neighboring sequences are conserved in the equivalent
      enhancer isolated from Drosophila virilis. Tsh protein produced under the control
      of the 220 bp enhancer partially rescues a null tsh mutation, with its strongest 
      effect in the even-numbered parasegments. Mutation of the Ftz binding sites
      partially abrogates the capacity for rescue. These results suggest a composite
      mechanism for regulation of tsh, with different activators such as ftz
      contributing to the overall pattern of expression of this key regulator.

TI  - Sequence, molecular organization and products of the Drosophila virilis homologs 
      of the D. melanogaster nested genes lethal(2) tumorous imaginal discs [1(2)tid]
      and lethal(2) neighbour of tid [1(2)not].
PG  - 91-103
AB  - In this study, we describe the isolation of the Drosophila virilis (Dvir) 6201-bp
      genomic fragment homologous to a 7047-bp genomic region of D. melanogaster (Dmel)
      that harbors the nested genes lethal(2) tumorous imaginal discs (l(2)tid),
      lethal(2) neighbour of tid (l(2)not) and lethal(2) relative of tid (l(2)rot). The
      isolated fragment, which maps at the cytogenetic position 50A5 on chromosome 5,
      carries the Dvir homologs of the Dmel genes l(2)tid and l(2)not. In both cases,
      the interspecific comparison of the determined sequences reveals a high homology 
      regarding the protein coding regions and a high degree of evolutionary divergence
      concerning the intronic parts of the genes. In the two distantly related species,
      the particular gene within gene arrangement of the two genes is conserved,
      namely, Dvir tid is located in the intron of Dvir not, on the non-coding DNA
      strand. Interestingly, the Dvir homolog of the Dmel l(2)rot gene residing in the 
      l(2)not intron on its coding strand, opposite l(2)tid, is not present in the
      6201-bp genomic fragment. The protein predicted from the Dvir tid sequence, Dvir 
      Tid58, exhibits 76.5% identity with the putative Tid56 protein of Dmel. The
      putative Dvir Not58 protein shows 71% identity with its Dmel homolog Not56. The
      developmental transcript and protein patterns, as well as the characteristics of 
      the protein products encoded by the genes Dvir tid and Dvir not are similar to
      those identified for their Dmel homologs.

      molluscs and insects: immunochemical and biochemical similarity between Mytilus
      male associated polypeptide (MAP) and Drosophila sex-specific esterase S.
PG  - 197-208
AB  - We suggested that sexual differentiation of the reproductive system in gonochoric
      species of invertebrates can be characterized by common molecular mechanisms in
      spite of high morphological divergences of reproductive tract organs in different
      animal groups. The present study focused on this problem and report our
      observations on biochemical characteristics of male-associated polypeptide (MAP) 
      identified in the gonad tissue of bivalve molluscs, Mytilus galloprovincialis, in
      comparison to those of male-specific carboxylesterase (esterase S) of Drosophila 
      virilis ejaculatory bulbs. We provide evidences for the immunochemical similarity
      of Mytilus MAP and Drosophila esterase S. We also show that MAP is characterized 
      by esterase activity toward both, alpha- and beta-naphthyl acetates. Using
      immunofluorescence, we found MAP in the gonad (mantle) connective tissue,
      membranes of follicles and around gonad ducts but not in sperm cells.
      Nevertheless, the levels of MAP expression depend on presence or absence of ripe 
      spermatozoa in the gonad follicles. In mature gonads before spawning, MAP is
      expressed at high level, while in the spent gonads only traces of this
      polypeptide could be detected. Using Western immunoblot, MAP was not observed in 
      spermatozoa obtained by biopsy of gonad follicles. In contrast, we found this
      protein in spawned sperm cells. Thus, we suggest that spawning may be required to
      establish the trafficking mechanisms that control whether MAP is retained or
      excreted by the gonad. Taken together, the results indicate that MAP of M.
      galloprovincialis is structurally and functionally related to esterase S of D.
      virilis ejaculatory bulbs.

TI  - The evolution of small gene clusters: evidence for an independent origin of the
      maltase gene cluster in Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 985-93
AB  - We analyzed a 5,770-bp genomic region of Drosophila virilis that contains a
      cluster of two maltase genes showing sequence similarity with genes in a cluster 
      of three maltase genes previously identified in Drosophila melanogaster. The D.
      virilis maltase genes are designated Mav1 and Mav2. In addition to being
      different in gene number, the cluster of genes in D. virilis differs dramatically
      in intron-exon structure from the maltase genes in D. melanogaster, the
      transcriptional orientation of the genes in the cluster also differs between the 
      species. Our findings support a model in which the maltase gene cluster in D.
      virilis and D. melanogaster evolved independently. Furthermore, while in D.
      melanogaster the maltase gene cluster lies only 10 kb distant from the larval
      cuticle gene cluster, the maltase and larval cuticle gene clusters in D. virilis 
      are located very far apart and on a different chromosome than that expected from 
      the known chromosome arm homologies between D. virilis and D. melanogaster. A
      region of the genome containing the maltase and larval cuticle gene clusters
      appears to have been relocated between nonhomologous chromosomes.

TI  - A screen for fast evolving genes from Drosophila.
PG  - 9746-50
AB  - In an attempt to quantify the rates of protein sequence divergence in Drosophila,
      we have devised a screen to differentiate between slow and fast evolving genes.
      We find that over one-third of randomly drawn cDNAs from a Drosophila
      melanogaster library do not cross-hybridize with Drosophila virilis DNA,
      indicating that they evolve with a very high rate. To determine the evolutionary 
      characteristics of such protein sequences, we sequenced their homologs from a
      more closely related species (Drosophila yakuba). The amino acid substitution
      rates among these cDNAs are among the fastest known and several are only about
      2-fold lower than the corresponding values for silent substitutions. An analysis 
      of within-species polymorphisms for one of these sequences reveals an
      exceptionally high number of polymorphic amino acid positions, indicating that
      the protein is not under strong negative selection. We conclude that the
      Drosophila genome harbors a substantial proportion of genes with a very high
      divergence rate.

TI  - Discordant rates of chromosome evolution in the Drosophila virilis species group.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - In Drosophila, the availability of polytene chromosome maps and of sets of probes
      covering most regions of the chromosomes allows a direct comparison of the
      organization of the genome in different species. In this work, we report the
      localization, in Drosophila virilis, D. montana, and D. novamexicana, of > 100
      bacteriophage PI clones containing approximately 65 kilobase inserts of genomic
      DNA from D. virilis. Each clone hybridizes with a single euchromatic site in
      either chromosome 1 or chromosome 3 in D. virilis. From these data, it is
      possible to estimate the minimum number of inversions required to transform the
      map positions of the probes in one species into the map positions of the same
      probes in a related species. The data indicate that, in the D. virilis species
      group, the X chromosome has up to four times the number of inversions as are
      observed in chromosome 3. The first photographic polytene chromosome maps for D. 
      montana and D. novamexicana are also presented.

TI  - Role of DOPA decarboxylase and N-acetyl transferase in regulation of dopamine
      content in Drosophila virilis under normal and heat stress conditions.
PG  - 729-34
AB  - Activity levels of DOPA decarboxylase (DDC), an enzyme responsible for dopamine
      (DA) synthesis, and of N-acetyl transferase (NAT), an enzyme responsible for its 
      degradation, were studied under normal and stress conditions in two lines of
      Drosophila virilis which are in contrast concerning their DA content under normal
      conditions and its alterations under stress. Interlinear differences in DDC
      activity were detected, and genetic analysis was carried out. It was found out
      that neither DDC nor NAT activity in D. virilis changed under stress. Based on
      the results of this study and data obtained earlier by the authors, a mechanism
      of DA content control under normal and stress conditions was proposed.

TI  - Two evolutionarily conserved repression domains in the Drosophila Kruppel protein
      differ in activator specificity.
PG  - 4820-9
AB  - To identify biologically functional regions in the product of the Drosophila
      melanogaster gene Kruppel, we cloned the Kruppel homolog from Drosophila virilis.
      Both the previously identified amino (N)-terminal repression region and the
      DNA-binding region of the D. virilis Kruppel protein are greater than 96%
      identical to those of the D. melanogaster Kruppel protein, demonstrating a
      selective pressure to maintain the integrity of each region during 60 million to 
      80 million years of evolution. An additional region in the carboxyl (C) terminus 
      of Kruppel that was most highly conserved was examined further. A 42-amino-acid
      stretch within the conserved C-terminal region also encoded a transferable
      repression domain. The short, C-terminal repression region is a composite of
      three subregions of distinct amino acid composition, each containing a high
      proportion of either basic, proline, or acidic residues. Mutagenesis experiments 
      demonstrated, unexpectedly, that the acidic residues contribute to repression
      function. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal repression regions were tested for
      the ability to affect transcription mediated by a variety of activator proteins. 
      The N-terminal repression region was able to inhibit transcription in the
      presence of multiple activators. However, the C-terminal repression region
      inhibited transcription by only a subset of the activator proteins. The different
      activator specificities of the two regions suggest that they repress
      transcription by different mechanisms and may play distinct biological roles
      during Drosophila development.

TI  - cDNA cloning of three cecropin-like antimicrobial peptides (Styelins) from the
      tunicate, Styela clava.
PG  - 144-8
AB  - We cloned precursors of three new antimicrobial peptides, Styelins C, D and E,
      from a pharyngeal cDNA library of a tunicate, Styela clava. Preprostyelins
      resembled dipteran preprocecropins, while the mature domain of Styelin C
      resembled Cecropin P1, an antimicrobial peptide purified from the porcine
      intestine. Beginning with the last 6 residues of their signal sequences, Styelin 
      C and Cecropin 1 from Drosophila virilis had 8/11 identical amino acids (72.7%). 
      Moreover, 4 of the last 6 residues of their mature peptide domains were also
      identical. Styelins were shorter, by 8 residues, than dipteran cecropins and
      preprostyelins contained a conserved, polyanionic C-terminal extension that was
      absent in preprocecropins. Delineation of cecropin-like antimicrobial peptides in
      a protochordate supports the antiquity of this family as effectors of innate
      immunity in animals and it increases the likelihood that additional cecropin-like
      peptides will be found among other evolutionary descendants of
      protochordates--vertebrates.

TI  - Twist-mediated activation of the NK-4 homeobox gene in the visceral mesoderm of
      Drosophila requires two distinct clusters of E-box regulatory elements.
PG  - 17531-41
AB  - NK-4, also called msh2 and tinman, encodes a homeodomain transcription factor
      that is required for the development of the dorsal mesoderm and its derivatives
      in the Drosophila embryo. Genetic analyses indicate that NK-4 resides downstream 
      of the mesodermal determinant twist, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix-type 
      transcription factor. However, the regulation of NK-4 by twist remains poorly
      understood. Using expression assays in cultured cells and transgenic flies, we
      show that two distinct clusters of E-box regulatory sequences, present upstream
      of the NK-4 gene, mediate NK-4 expression in the visceral mesoderm. These
      elements are conserved between the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis
      NK-4 genes and serve as binding sites for Twist (E1 cluster) and NK-4 (E2
      cluster) proteins. In cultured cells, Twist and NK-4 binding results in
      activation of NK-4 gene expression. In transgenic animals, the E1 and E2 clusters
      are functionally connected, and both elements are required for NK-4 activation in
      cells of the visceral mesoderm and also for NK-4 repression in cells of the
      somatic musculature. These results demonstrate that NK-4 is a direct
      transcriptional target for Twist and its own gene product in visceral mesodermal 
      cells, supporting the idea that twist and NK-4 function in the subdivision of the
      mesoderm during Drosophila embryogenesis.

      chromosome 2. In line 101, short-term heat stress (38 degrees C, 60 min) resulted
      in reduction in TDC activity, whereas, in line 147, this activity remained
      unchanged.

TI  - A framework physical map of Drosophila virilis based on P1 clones: applications
      in genome evolution.
PG  - 99-107
AB  - The analysis of patterns of genome evolution may help to evaluate the
      evolutionary forces that shape the composition and organization of the genome.
      Comparisons between the physical maps of divergent species can be used to
      identify conserved blocks of closely linked genes whose synteny is possibly under
      selective constraint. We have used in situ hybridization to determine the genomic
      position of 732 randomly selected clones from a bacteriophage P1 library of
      Drosophila virilis. The resulting map includes at least one clone in each of 69% 
      of the subdivisions into which the D. virilis polytene chromosomes are divided. A
      subset of these clones was used to carry out a comparative physical analysis of
      chromosome 2 from D. virilis and from Drosophila montana. A number of
      discrepancies with the classical scenario of chromosome evolution were noted. The
      D. virilis P1 clones were also used to determine the physical relations between
      ten genes that are located in the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster between
      the markers crn (2F1) and omb (4C5-6). In this region, which is approximately 2
      Mb in length, there have been at least six breakpoints since the divergence of
      the species, and six of the genes are found at widely scattered locations in the 
      D. virilis X chromosome. However, a block of four functionally unrelated genes,
      including white, roughest, Notch, and dunce, seems to be conserved between the
      two species.

AB  - In adults of two Drosophila virilis lines displaying different genetically
      determined reactions to stress, N-acetyl-transferase (NAT) activity against
      substrates dopamine and octapamine was studied. Sexual dimorphism was
      characteristic of NAT activity when octapamine served as a substrate. However, in
      the case of dopamine, this phenomenon was not found. This suggests that two
      different enzymes with N-acetyltransferase activities exist in D. virilis. The
      flies of the studied lines were not shown to be indistinguishable in both enzyme 
      activities. Short-term stress (38 degrees C for 30 and 60 min) did not affect NAT
      activity in flies of either studied line.

TI  - [An electron microscopic study of the structure of the spermatozoa from sterile
      males from a crossing of Drosophila virilis x Drosophila lummei].
PG  - 223-31
AB  - Using electron microscope, we have studied structure of the tail region of
      developing spermatozoa in sterile hybrid males FB1 and F2 resulting from D.
      virilis x D. lummei crosses, as well as in fertile males of D. virilis. Multiple 
      disturbances in the structure of spermatid plasma membrane have been found in
      sterile males. The membrane is interrupted in many points; this is particularly
      apparent in the outer thicker layer. The adjacent nucleus (AN) of spermatids of
      hybrids also differs from that in D. virilis spermatid. The crystalline
      ultrastructure in this case has a lower volume as compared with D. virilis, it is
      located asymmetrically within the AN and is displaced to the edge of that part of
      the AN, which is located closely to the bundle of contractile fibrils. At the
      stage of elongation, nonuniform inclusions of irregular shape, several times
      larger than globules of the crystalline structure, are located nonuniformly
      within this crystal-like structure. The membrane of the AN is interrupted in many
      points or is fully absent. Matrix consisting of a large number of small globules 
      is distributed nonuniformly within the AN. It is concluded that the presence of
      multiple disturbances of spermatid ultra-structure is the main factor leading to 
      lack of sperm mobility and, correspondingly, sterility of virilis-lummei hybrid
      males.

TI  - Evolutionary conservation of regulatory strategies for the sex determination
      factor transformer-2.
PG  - 2908-19
AB  - Sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by a cascade of
      splicing factors which direct the sex-specific expression of gene products needed
      for male and female differentiation. The splicing factor TRA-2 affects
      sex-specific splicing of multiple pre-mRNAs involved in sexual differentiation.
      The tra-2 gene itself expresses a complex set of mRNAs generated through
      alternative processing that collectively encode three distinct protein isoforms. 
      The expression of these isoforms differs in the soma and germ line. In the male
      germ line the ratio of two isoforms present is governed by autoregulation of
      splicing. However, the functional significance of multiple TRA-2 isoforms has
      remained uncertain. Here we have examined whether the structure, function, and
      regulation of tra-2 are conserved in Drosophila virilis, a species diverged from 
      D. melanogaster by over 60 million years. We find that the D. virilis homolog of 
      tra-2 produces alternatively spliced RNAs encoding a set of protein isoforms
      analogous to those found in D. melanogaster. When introduced into the genome of
      D. melanogaster, this homolog can functionally replace the endogenous tra-2 gene 
      for both normal female sexual differentiation and spermatogenesis. Examination of
      alternative mRNAs produced in D. virilis testes suggests that germ line-specific 
      autoregulation of tra-2 function is accomplished by a strategy similar to that
      used in D. melanogaster. The similarity in structure and function of the tra-2
      genes in these divergent Drosophila species supports the idea that sexual
      differentiation in D. melanogaster and D. virilis is accomplished under the
      control of similar regulatory pathways.

TI  - A Drosophila melanogaster hobo-white(+) vector mediates low frequency gene
      transfer in D. virilis with full interspecific white(+) complementation.
PG  - 165-71
AB  - Transformation of a Drosophila virilis white mutant host strain was attempted
      using a hobo vector containing the D. melanogaster mini-white(+) cassette
      (H[w(+), hawN]) and an unmodified or heat shock regulated hobo transposase
      helper. Two transformant lines were recovered with the unmodified helper (HFL1), 
      one containing only the white(+) marked vector, and a sibling line containing the
      vector as well as an HFL1 helper integration. An approximate total transformation
      frequency of 1% is deduced. A high frequency of wing and eye morphology mutants
      were also observed, suggesting that hobo may have mobilized a related element in 
      D. virilis. The data reaffirms a relatively low transformation vector activity
      for the hobo transposon in D. virilis; however, nearly full interspecific
      expression white(+) marker supports its possible function in other species as
      well.

TI  - Tyrosine decarboxylase and dopa decarboxylase in Drosophila virilis under normal 
      conditions and heat stress: genetic and physiological aspects.
PG  - 91-103
AB  - The activity of tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC) was
      studied in adults of two lines of Drosophila virilis, contrasting in their
      reaction to stress conditions. Differences were found in the activity of both
      enzymes between individuals of the examined lines. Genetic analysis of these
      differences was made. Each of the two enzymes was found to be controlled by a
      single gene or, possibly, by a block of closely linked genes. The gene
      responsible for TDC activity is located on one of the autosomes (excluding
      chromosome II). DDC activity in D. virilis is regulated by a gene located,
      apparently, on chromosome II. Adults of the line responding to stress by a stress
      reaction (r-line) were shown to react to a short-term heat stress (38 degrees C, 
      60 min) by a decrease in TDC activity. TDC activity in flies of the line
      incapable of the stress reaction (nr-line) did not alter in such conditions. DDC 
      activity of adults of both lines was found to be unchangeable under stress
      conditions.

AB  - Genetic analysis of male sterility in Drosophila virilis x D. lummei hybrids was 
      performed. It was shown that hybrid male sterility was caused mainly by
      incompatibility of sex chromosomes X and Y and homozygous chromosome 2 of D.
      virilis with other autosomes of D. lummei. Genes of chromosomes 3 and 5 enhanced 
      sterility whereas genes of chromosome 4 suppressed its development. Factors
      controlling hybrid male sterility were demonstrated to have a recessive type of
      inheritance. At 17 degrees C, chromosome 6 of D. lummei was eliminated in F1
      hybrids of the cross female D. virilis x male D. lummei. At 17 degrees C and 25
      degrees C, sterility of the F1 hybrid males was 96% and 9%, respectively. Thus,
      two isolation mechanisms-elimination of chromosome 6 and male sterility-can
      simultaneously operate in F1. In addition to the region of the species-specific
      inversion In 1(a+b), factors controlling male sterility were mapped to the
      vermillion region of the X chromosome.

TI  - Identification and characterization of the Cecropin antibacterial protein gene
      locus in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 272-81
AB  - Cecropin is a type of antibacterial peptide that is synthesized in response to
      infection and has been characterized in many insect species and one mammal. The
      Cecropin locus of Drosophila melanogaster also contains the gene Andropin, which 
      has been identified only in this species and encodes a male-specific
      antibacterial peptide. As a first step in studying the molecular evolution of the
      cecropin and andropin genes among Drosophila species, we have isolated genomic
      clones that cover the Cecropin locus in Drosophila virilis. The cloned region
      totals approximately 25 kb, within which a 9-kb fragment contains four cecropin
      genes and one pseudogene. All four genes have a high level of sequence homology
      to D. melanogaster Cecropin, about 80% identity in the coding regions, and the
      intron positions are conserved. As in D. melanogaster and other insects, kappa
      B-related cis-regulatory elements are found upstream of these cecropin genes. An 
      Andropin-related sequence was not identified in D. virilis; however, genome
      Southern hybridizations suggest that Andropin-related sequences are present in at
      least the melanogaster species subgroup. Analysis of 19 insect cecropin genes
      identifies a common ancestral Cecropin before the divergence of Diptera and
      Lepidoptera. In addition, D. melanogaster and D. virilis can be identified by
      monophyletic clades for Cecropin. In contrast, the Lepidopteran species show
      polyphyletic relationships for duplicated cecropin genes.

TI  - The putative cell cycle gene, enhancer of rudimentary, encodes a highly conserved
      protein found in plants and animals.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - The enhancer of rudimentary gene, e(r), in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a
      protein, ER, whose function has been implicated in pyrimidine biosynthesis and
      the cell cycle (Wojcik et al. (1994) Genetics 138, 1163-1170). In order to
      identify conserved regions of the protein and potentially important functional
      domains, the e(r) gene was cloned and sequenced from two other insects
      (Drosophila virilis and Aedes aegypti) and three vertebrates (Homo sapiens, Mus
      musculus, and Brachydanio rerio) and sequenced from a flowering plant
      (Arabidopsis thaliana). These sequences along with those of a nematode
      (Caenorhabditis elegans) exhibit a high degree of identity. ER of Drosophila
      melanogaster is 76% identical to the three vertebrate proteins, 49% identical to 
      the nematode protein, and 40% identical to the plant protein. There is high
      evolutionary conservation among the vertebrates. The mouse and human proteins are
      identical and differ from that of the zebrafish by a single conservative
      amino-acid change (valine for isoleucine). A dramatic sequence conservation is
      seen in the position of the hydrophobic amino acids. Of the 27 positions occupied
      by hydrophobic amino acids in ER of Drosophila melanogaster, 25 of the
      corresponding positions in the human protein, 23 of the positions in
      Caenorhabditis elegans, and 20 of the positions in Arabidopsis thaliana have
      hydrophobic amino acids. Most of these residues are present in three conserved
      amphipathic alpha-helices, which are proposed to function in protein-protein
      interactions. Two phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (CKII) have also
      been conserved within the animal groups. Purified ER from Drosophila melanogaster
      is phosphorylated in vitro by CKII, arguing that these two sites are functional
      in vivo. A putative shift in the secondary structure of ER caused by the
      phosphorylation of these sites suggests that CKII may be regulating the activity 
      of the ER in vivo.

TI  - Penelope, a new family of transposable elements and its possible role in hybrid
      dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 196-201
AB  - A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome occurs in Drosophila virilis when males from an
      established laboratory strain are crossed to females obtained from the wild,
      causing the simultaneous mobilization of several different transposable elements.
      The insertion sequence responsible for the mutant phenotype of a dysgenic yellow 
      allele has been characterized and named Penelope. In situ hybridization and
      Southern analyses reveal the presence of more than 30 copies of this element in
      the P-like parental strain, whereas Penelope is absent in all M-like strains
      tested. Penelope contains one 2.5-kb-long ORF that could encode products with
      homology to integrase and reverse transcriptase. Northern analysis and
      whole-mount in situ hybridization show strong induction of a 2.6-kb RNA in the
      ovaries of dysgenic females that is expressed at very low levels in the parental 
      strains or in the progeny from the reciprocal cross. Injection of
      Penelope-containing plasmids into preblastoderm embryos of an M-like strain
      results in mutant progeny caused by insertion of Ulysses and perhaps other
      transposons, suggesting that Penelope expression might be responsible for the
      observed dysgenesis syndrome and the simultaneous mobilization of other
      transposable elements.

TI  - Modern thoughts on an ancyent marinere: function, evolution, regulation.
PG  - 337-58
AB  - The mariner/Tc1 superfamily of transposable elements is one of the most diverse
      and widespread Class II transposable elements. Within the larger assemblage, the 
      mariner-like elements (MLEs) and the Tc1-like elements (TLEs) are distinct
      families differing characteristically in the composition of the "D,D(35)E"
      cation-binding domain. Based on levels of sequence similarity, the elements in
      each family can be subdivided further into several smaller subfamilies. MLEs and 
      TLEs both have an extraordinarily wide host range. They are abundant in insect
      genomes and other invertebrates and are found even in some vertebrate species
      including, in the case of mariner, humans, in which one element on chromosome 17p
      has been implicated as a hotspot of recombination. In spite of the extraordinary 
      evolutionary success of the elements, virtually nothing is known about their mode
      of regulation within genomes. There is abundant evidence that the elements are
      disseminated to naive host genomes by horizontal transmission, and there is a
      substantial base of evidence for inference about the subsequent population
      dynamics. Studies of engineered mariner elements and induced mutations in the
      transposase have identified two mechanisms that may be operative in mariner
      regulation. One mechanism is overproduction inhibition, in which excessive
      wild-type transposase reduces the rate of excision of a target element. A second 
      mechanism is dominant-negative complementation, in which certain mutant
      transposase proteins antagonize the activity of the wild-type transposase. The
      latter process may help explain why the vast majority of MLEs in nature undergo
      "vertical inactivation" by multiple mutations and, eventually, stochastic loss.
      There is also evidence that mariner/Tc1 elements can be mobilized in hybrid
      dysgenesis; in particular, certain dysgenic crosses in Drosophila virilis result 
      in mobilization of a TLE designated Paris as well as the mobilization of other
      unrelated transposable elements.

TI  - Ovarian defects in hybrids of the species pair Drosophila virilis and Drosophila 
      texana.
PG  - 47-52
AB  - In interspecific matings between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila texana female 
      sterility is observed in F2 hybrid females. A previous study has shown that no
      vitellogenin synthesis occurs in the fat body of sterile hybrid females. The
      results presented in this paper show that hybrid ovaries of sterile females
      transplanted into the abdomens of females of the parental species are not able to
      develop upon maturity. With few exceptions, the hybrid ovaries remained alive in 
      the host environment, but their oocytes failed to develop to vitellogenic stages.
      Thus, in hybrid females between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila texana
      sterility is the result of defects in both the two main developmental processes
      of egg maturation, the synthesis of vitellogenins in the fat body and the uptake 
      of vitellogenins by the ovary.

TI  - In vivo length oscillations of indirect flight muscles in the fruit fly
      Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 2767-74
AB  - We have used high-speed video microscopy to measure in vivo length oscillations
      of the indirect flight muscles of the fruit fly Drosophila virilis during
      tethered flight. The changes in muscle strain were measured by tracking the
      deformation of the thoracic exoskeleton at the origin and insertion of both the
      dorsal longitudinal (DLM) and the dorsal ventral (DVM) muscles. The mean
      peak-to-peak strain amplitudes were found to be 3.5% for the DLMs and 3.3% for
      the DVMs, although the strain amplitude within individual cycles ranged from 2 to
      5%. These values are consistent with the small number of previous measurements of
      indirect flight muscle strain in other insects, but almost an order of magnitude 
      greater than the strain amplitudes used in most biophysical studies of skinned
      Drosophila fibers. The results suggest that serial compliance within this
      sarcomere would need to relieve approximately 70% of the total strain in order
      for individual crossbridges to remain attached throughout a complete
      contraction-extension cycle.

TI  - DNA sequence variation at the period locus reveals the history of species and
      speciation events in the Drosophila virilis group.
PG  - 1015-25
AB  - The virilis phylad of the Drosophila virilis group consists of five closely
      related taxa: D. virilis, D. lummei, D. novamexicana, D. americana americana and 
      D. americana texana. DNA sequences from a 2.1-kb pair portion of the period locus
      were generated in four to eight individuals from each of the five taxa. We found 
      evidence of recombination and high levels of variation within species. We found
      no evidence of recent natural selection. Surprisingly there was no evidence of
      divergence between D. a. americana and D. a. texana, and they collectively appear
      to have had a large historical effective population size. The ranges of these two
      taxa overlap in a large hybrid zone that has been delineated in the eastern U.S. 
      on the basis of the geographic pattern of a chromosomal fusion. Also
      surprisingly, D. novamexicana appears to consist of two distinct groups each with
      low population size and no gene flow between them.

TI  - Structural and functional conservation of the Drosophila doublesex splicing
      enhancer repeat elements.
PG  - 969-81
AB  - We have compared the RNA sequences and secondary structures of the Drosophila
      melanogaster and Drosophila virilis doublesex (dsx) splicing enhancers. The
      sequences of the two splicing enhancers are highly divergent except for the
      presence of nearly identical 13-nt repeat elements (six in D. melanogaster and
      four in D. virilis) and a stretch of nucleotides at the 5' and 3' ends of the
      enhancers. In vitro RNA structure probing of the two enhancers revealed that the 
      13-nt repeats are predominantly single-stranded. Thus, both the primary sequences
      and single-stranded nature of the repeats are conserved between the two species. 
      The significance of the primary sequence conservation was demonstrated by showing
      that the two enhancers are functionally interchangeable in Tra-/Tra2-dependent in
      vitro splicing. In addition, inhibition of splicing enhancer activity by
      antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the repeats demonstrated the
      importance of the conserved single-stranded structure of the repeats. In vitro
      binding studies revealed that Tra2 interacts with each of the D. melanogaster
      repeat elements, except for repeat 2, with affinities that are indistinguishable,
      whereas Tra binds nonspecifically to the enhancer. Taken together, these
      observations indicate that the organization of sequences within the dsx splicing 
      enhancers of D. melanogaster and D. virilis results in a structure in which each 
      of the repeat elements is single-stranded and therefore accessible for specific
      recognition by the RNA-binding domain of Tra2.

AB  - The effect of heat stress on the system of degradation of juvenile hormone (JH)
      and on fertility of Drosophila virilis and D. melanogaster was studied. In
      wild-type strains of both species, stress resulted in delay of oviposition and in
      a decrease in JH hydrolysis and fertility, which lasted for several days after
      heat treatment. Experimental repression of juvenile hormone esterase showed that 
      stress response of the Drosophila reproductive system is determined by the
      decrease in JH hydrolysis. Fertility of Drosophila strains that did not respond
      to stress by decreasing JH degradation level was not reduced under stress. The
      role of JH metabolism in Drosophila reproduction under stress and in adaptation
      of natural Drosophila populations to stressful environments is discussed.

TI  - A comparative analysis of juvenile hormone metabolyzing enzymes in two species of

PG  - 829-35
AB  - The course of changes in the activities of enzymes degrading juvenile hormone
      (JH), epoxyde hydrolase (JHEH) and JH-esterase (JHE) was studied in two lines of 
      Drosophila virilis (101 and 147) and in two lines of D. melanogaster (Canton-S
      and 921283). It was established for D. virilis that changes in the JH titre
      during pupal-adult development is determined by the activity level of JHE rather 
      then JHEH, while in D. melanogaster developmental changes in JH titre are related
      to changes in the activity level of both JHE and JHEH. In adults of D. virilis,
      the high level of JH-hydrolysing activity is determined by JHE and in those of D.
      melanogaster by JHEH. Differences in the course of changes in the JHE activity
      level between adults of lines 101 and 147 of D. virilis were found, and also in
      the JHEH activity level between adults of lines Canton S and 921283 of D.
      melanogaster. It was shown that attainment of a definite JHE activity level in
      females of lines 101 and 147 agrees well with the onset of oviposition of
      fertilized eggs. The possible role of JHE in reproduction of D. virilis is
      discussed.

TI  - Genetic analysis of Drosophila virilis sex pheromone: genetic mapping of the
      locus producing Z-(11)-pentacosene.
PG  - 17-21
AB  - Z-(11)-pentacosene, Drosophila virilis sex pheromone, is predominant among the
      female cuticular hydrocarbons and can elicit male courtship behaviours. To
      evaluate the genetic basis of its production, interspecific crosses between D.
      novamexicana and genetically marked D. virilis were made and hydrocarbon profiles
      of their backcross progeny were analysed. The production of Z-(11)-pentacosene
      was autosomally controlled and was recessive. Of the six D. virilis chromosomes
      only the second and the third chromosomes showed significant contributions to sex
      pheromone production, and acted additively. Analysis of recombinant females
      indicated that the locus on the second chromosome mapped to the proximity of
      position 2-218.

PG  - 273-9
AB  - The complete protein-coding region of the Drosophila virilis 60 A gene, a member 
      of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, was isolated and sequenced.
      The mature domain of the protein-coding region is 99% identical to the Drosophila
      melanogaster 60 A gene and 73% identical to human bone morphogenetic protein 5.
      In the pro-domain, a number of large blocks of amino acids are also highly
      conserved, indicating an important functional role for this portion of the
      protein as well. In the putative 5' and 3' untranslated regions, several short
      sequence motifs are conserved between D. virilis and D. melanogaster.

TI  - Evolutionary changes in the expression pattern of a developmentally essential
      gene in three Drosophila species.
PG  - 7103-7
AB  - The hypothesis that morphological evolution may largely result from changes in
      gene regulation rather than gene structure has been difficult to test.
      Morphological differences among insects are often apparent in the cuticle
      structures produced. The dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) and alpha-methyldopa
      hypersensitive (amd) genes arose from an ancient gene duplication. In Drosophila,
      they have evolved nonoverlapping functions, including the production of distinct 
      types of cuticle, and for Ddc, the production of the neurotransmitters, dopamine 
      and serotonin. The amd gene is particularly active in the production of
      specialized flexible cuticles in the developing embryo. We have compared the
      pattern of amd expression in three Drosophila species. Several regions of
      expression conserved in all three species but, surprisingly, a unique domain of
      expression is found in Drosophila simulans that does occur in the closely related
      (2-5 million years) Drosophila melanogaster or in the more remote (40-50 million 
      years) Drosophila virilis. The "sudden" appearance of a completely new and robust
      domain of expression provides a glimpse of evolutionary variation resulting from 
      changes in regulation of structural gene expression.

TI  - Recognizing the forest for the trees: testing temporal patterns of cladogenesis
      using a null model of stochastic diversification.
PG  - 833-49
AB  - Computer simulations are developed and employed to examine the expected temporal 
      distributions of nodes under a null model of stochastic lineage bifurcation and
      extinction. These Markovian models of phylogenetic process were constructed so as
      to permit direct comparisons against empirical phylogenetic trees generated from 
      molecular or other information available solely from extant species. For
      replicate simulated phylads with n extant species, cumulative distribution
      functions (cdf's) of branching times were calculated, and compared (using the
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic D) to those from three published empirical
      trees. Molecular phylogenies for columbine plants and avian cranes showed
      statistically significant departures from the null expectations, in directions
      indicating recent and ancient species' radiations, respectively, whereas a
      molecular phylogeny for the Drosophila virilis species group showed no apparent
      historical clustering of branching events. Effects of outgroup choice and
      phylogenetic frame of reference were investigated for the columbines and found to
      have a predictable influence on the types of conclusions to be drawn from such
      analyses. To enable other investigators to statistically test for nonrandomness
      in temporal cladogenetic pattern in empirical trees generated from data on extant
      species, we present tables of mean cdf's and associated probabilities under the
      null model for expected branching times in phylads of varying size. The
      approaches developed in this report complement and extend those of other recent
      methods for employing null models to assess the statistical significance of
      pattern in evolutionary trees.

TI  - Incompatibilities between Y chromosome and autosomes are responsible for male
      hybrid sterility in crosses between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila texana.
PG  - 603-9
AB  - Crosses between Drosophila virilis and D. texana produce viable and fertile F1
      males and females. When F1 males are backcrossed to either parental species they 
      also produced fertile sons. However, about one-third of F1 males carrying the D. 
      texana Y chromosome are sterile. When fertile F1 males with the D. texana Y
      chromosome are crossed to D. virilis, about three quarters of the sons are
      sterile. We show that these sterilities result from incompatibilities between the
      D. texana Y chromosome and at least two of the D. virilis autosomes. X/Y
      incompatibilities can be excluded in this pair of species, and X/autosome
      incompatibilities appear to be either absent or to play a minor role in the
      sterility of male progeny from backcrosses of F1 males to females from either
      species. It is suggested that Y/autosome incompatibilities may be among the first
      to appear in the development of postzygotic isolation in Drosophila.

TI  - Identification of cis-acting sequences that control nanos RNA localization.
PG  - 36-50
AB  - The generation of anterior-posterior polarity during development in Drosophila
      requires the localization of determinant molecules to the anterior and posterior 
      poles of the embryo. Localization of the maternally synthesized nanos RNA to the 
      posterior pole of the embryo is essential to provide a source for a gradient of
      Nanos protein that directs abdomen formation. nanos RNA localization occurs
      during oogenesis and requires the function of at least nine genes. cis-acting
      sequences that direct nanos RNA localization lie within the nanos 3'UTR. In this 
      analysis, we have used nanos 3'UTR deletion mutants to define the localization
      signal more precisely. Our results indicate that the nanos RNA localization
      signal is large and complex and that targeting of nanos RNA may be achieved by
      the combined effects of multiple, partially independent sequences. This idea is
      supported by evolutionary conservation, both in sequence and in function, of the 
      nanos 3'UTRs of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis.

      development, glass transcription in the developing eye begins in the

      fragment can confer near wild-type expression in the developing eye. We completed
      the sequence of a similar Drosophila virilis fragment and comparison of these two
      genomic sequences reveals seven perfectly conserved sequence elements of 15 bp
      (or longer). We placed oligomers of each element 5' to an hsp70 promoter-lacZ
      fusion construct, and examined the patterns of beta-galactosidase expression
      produced in transgenic files. Three of these elements drive beta-galactosidase
      expression in the developing eye, and one is inhibitory.

TI  - Germline transformation of Drosophila virilis with the transposable element
      mariner.
PG  - 365-74
AB  - An important goal in molecular genetics has been to identify a transposable
      element that might serve as an efficient transformation vector in diverse species
      of insects. The transposable element mariner occurs naturally in a wide variety
      of insects. Although virtually all mariner elements are nonfunctional, the Mos1
      element isolated from Drosophila mauritiana is functional. Mos1 was injected into
      the pole-cell region of embryos of D. virilis, which last shared a common
      ancestor with D. mauritiana 40 million years ago. Mos1 PCR fragments were
      detected in several pools of DNA from progeny of injected animals, and backcross 
      lines were established. Because G0 lines were pooled, possibly only one
      transformation event was actually obtained, yielding a minimum frequency of 4%.
      Mos1 segregated in a Mendelian fashion, demonstrating chromosomal integration.
      The copy number increased by spontaneous mobilization. In situ hybridization
      confirmed multiple polymorphic locations of Mos1. Integration results in a
      characteristic 2-bp TA duplication. One Mos1 element integrated into a tandem
      array of 370-bp repeats. Some copies may have integrated into heterochromatin, as
      evidenced by their ability to support PCR amplification despite absence of a
      signal in Southern and in situ hybridization.

PG  - 126-30
AB  - Time-related changes in the activity of enzymes that degrade the juvenile
      hormone, epoxide hydrolase, and juvenile hormone esterase, was studied in two
      strains (101 and 147) of Drosophila virilis. The changes of the juvenile hormone 
      titer during the pupal-imaginal development of D.virilis are determined by the
      juvenile hormone esterase activity, rather than epoxide hydrolase. Among the two 
      forms of juvenile hormone esterase present in D. virilis, one is
      diisopropylphosphofluoridate-sensitive and active during the studied period,
      while the other, diisopropylphosphofluoridate-sensitive, is present only during
      metamorphosis and before flight of imago and is practically absent in sexually
      mature individuals. Interstrain differences were shown in the activity of the
      diisopropylphosphofluoridate-insensitive form in the D. virilis imago. It was
      shown that achievement of a certain level of its activity in females of strains
      101 and 147 agrees quite well with the timing of oviposition. A possible role of 
      this form of the juvenile hormone esterase in reproduction of D. virilis is
      discussed.

PG  - 173-7
AB  - A laboratory strain of Drosophila virilis was genetically transformed with a hobo
      vector carrying the miniwhite cassette using a helper plasmid with an
      hsp70-driven hobo transposase-coding sequence. The rate of transformation was
      0.5% per fertile GO animal. Three transgenic insertions were cloned and
      characterized and found to be authentic hobo insertions. These results, together 
      with the known widespread distribution of hobo in diverse insect species, suggest
      that hobo and related transposable elements may be of considerable utility in the
      germline transformation of insects other than D. melanogaster.

PG  - 289-95
AB  - In interspecific matings between the species Drosophila virilis and Drosophila
      texana, female sterility can be observed in F2 backcross females and in F2 hybrid
      females. The results presented in this report show that the female sterility,
      whenever it exists, is due to prevention of vitellogenin synthesis in the fat
      body, but other abnormalities such as defects with the hybrid ovaries are not
      excluded. The observation that sterility appears among females from backcrosses
      suggests that incompatibilities between interspecific genes may cause female
      sterility even in the presence of a complete habloid genome from one or the other
      species. Yet, the parallel observation that female sterility appears only in
      hybrid females with recombinant chromosomes indicates that sterility results when
      conspecific combinations of genes on the same chromosome are broken by
      interspecific recombination.

AB  - Genetic control of changes in alkaline phosphatase activity was studied in adult 
      individuals from two strains of Drosophila virilis under normal conditions and at
      a high temperature (38 degrees C). Flies from strain 101 responded to the heat
      shock with a reduction in enzyme activity, whereas flies from strain 147 lacked
      this response. Strains 101 and 147 were shown to differ in alkaline phosphatase
      activity at a normal temperature. Genetic analysis of these differences was
      performed. They were shown to be controlled monogenically (or by a battery of
      tightly linked genes). The gene determining alkaline phosphatase activity was
      localized on an autosome.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny and genome evolution in the Drosophila virilis species group:
      duplications of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene.
PG  - 132-49
AB  - Drosophila virilis is a prominent reference species for comparison with
      Drosophila melanogaster in regard to patterns and mechanisms of molecular and
      genomic evolution. Sequences were determined for 11 Adh genes from 8 species of
      the D. virilis species group, including species from both the virilis phylad and 
      the montana subphylad. The genome of D. virilis contains a 6-kb duplication that 
      includes the entire Adh coding region. The pattern of sequence identity within
      the duplication strongly suggests a recent gene-conversion event bordered by
      36-bp indels. As in other Drosophila, the amino-acid coding region of Adh is
      encoded by three exons interrupted by two short introns. The promoter region
      includes 16 blocks of sequence that are well conserved in D. virilis, Drosophila 
      hydei, and D. melanogaster. The developmental profile of Adh transcription
      suggests a distal/proximal promoter switch analogous to that in D. melanogaster. 
      Duplicate Adh genes were also found in Drosophila montana and Drosophila
      lacicola, which apparently originated independently of that in D. virilis. The
      Adh genes in all species of the D. virilis group have among the lowest codon bias
      of any Adh genes so far reported in the genus Drosophila. Taking the low codon
      bias into account, we estimate the time of divergence between the virilis and
      montana clades as 9.0 +/- 0.7 Mya and the approximate time of divergence of D.
      virilis from other members of the virilis phylad as 2.6 +/- 0.4 Mya. The region
      of the D. virilis genome containing Adh, as well as the chromosome as a whole,
      gives evidence of extensive rearrangements relative to the genome of D.
      melanogaster.

TI  - High divergence of reproductive tract proteins and their association with
      postzygotic reproductive isolation in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila
      virilis group species.
PG  - 1085-95
AB  - The possible association between gonadal protein divergence and postzygotic
      reproductive isolation was investigated among species of the Drosophila
      melanogaster and D. virilis groups. Protein divergence was scored by
      high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Close to 500 protein spots
      from gonadal tissues (testis and ovary) and nongonadal tissues (malpighian
      tubules and brain) were analyzed and protein divergence was calculated based on
      presence vs absence. Both testis and ovary proteins showed higher divergence than
      nongonadal proteins, and also a highly significant positive correlation with
      postzygotic reproductive isolation but a weaker correlation with postzygotic
      reproductive isolation. Particularly, a positive and significant correlation was 
      found between proteins expressed in the testis and postzygotic reproductive
      isolation among closely related species such as the within-phylad species in the 
      D. virilis group. The high levels of male-reproductive-tract protein divergence
      between species might be associated with F1 hybrid male sterility among closely
      related species. If so, a lower level of ovary protein divergence should be
      expected on the basis that F1 female hybrids are fully fertile. However, this is 
      not necessarily true if relatively few genes are responsible for the reproductive
      isolation observed between closely related species, as recent studies seem to
      suggest. We suggest that the faster rate of evolution of gonadal proteins in
      comparison to nongonadal proteins and the association of that rate with
      postzygotic reproductive isolation may be the result of episodic and/or sexual
      selection on male and female molecular traits.

TI  - The pvB370 BamHI satellite DNA family of the Drosophila virilis group and its
      evolutionary relation to mobile dispersed genetic pDv elements.
PG  - 604-14
AB  - The pvB370 BamHI tandemly repeated satellite DNA family was isolated and analyzed
      in eight species of the Drosophila virilis group and is probably common to all
      its members. Unexpectedly, the satellite DNA family showed similar levels of
      intra- and interspecific sequence variability. An EMBL gene-bank search revealed 
      a high degree of similarity between the members of the pvB370 BamHI satellite DNA
      sequence family and the direct terminal repeats of the mobile dispersed genetic
      pDv elements described in D. virilis and other species of the group. However, no 
      similarity was observed to the transcribed and translated part of the pDv
      elements. It is suggested that the satellite DNA repeats are phylogenetically
      older than the mobile dispersed genetic pDv element and that the functional pDv
      elements might have derived from the satellite DNA family through an insertion of
      a tandemly repeated 36-bp transcription unit.

TI  - Evolutionary divergence of the cytochrome b5 gene of Drosophila.
PG  - 430-9
AB  - Cytochrome proteins perform a broad spectrum of biological functions ranging from
      oxidative metabolism to electron transport and are thus essential to all
      organisms. The b-type cytochrome proteins bind heme noncovalently, are expressed 
      in many different forms and are localized to various cellular compartments. We
      report the characterization of the cytochrome b5 (Cyt-b) gene of Drosophila
      virilis and compare its structure to the Cyt-b gene of Drosophila melanogaster.
      As in D. melanogaster, the D. virilis gene is nuclear encoded and single copy.
      Although the intron/exon structures of these homologues differ, the Cyt-b
      proteins of D. melanogaster and D. virilis are approximately 75% identical and
      share the same size coding regions (1,242 nucleotides) and protein products (414 
      amino acids). The Drosophila Cyt-b proteins show sequence similarity to other
      b-type cytochromes, especially in the N-terminal heme-binding domain, and may be 
      targeted to the mitochondrial membrane. The greatest levels of similarity are
      observed in areas of potential importance for protein structure and function. The
      exon sequences of the D. virilis Cyt-b gene differ by a total of 292 base
      changes. However, 62% of these changes are silent. The high degree of
      conservation between species separated by 60 million years of evolution in both
      the DNA and amino acid sequences suggests this nuclear cytochrome b5 locus
      encodes an essential product of the Drosophila system.

TI  - Conservation and function of the transcriptional regulatory protein Runt.
PG  - 9087-91
AB  - A phylogenetic approach was used to identify conserved regions of the
      transcriptional regulator Runt. Alignment of the deduced protein sequences from
      Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila virilis
      revealed eight blocks of high sequence homology separated by regions with little 
      or no homology. The largest conserved block contains the Runt domain, a DNA and
      protein binding domain conserved in a small family of mammalian transcription
      factors. The functional properties of the Runt domain from the D. melanogaster
      gene and the human AML1 (acute myeloid leukemia 1) gene were compared in vitro
      and in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays with Runt/AML1 chimeras
      demonstrated that the different DNA binding properties of Runt and AML1 are due
      to differences within their respective Runt domains. Ectopic expression
      experiments indicated that proteins containing the AML1 Runt domain function in
      Drosophila embryos and that sequences outside of this domain are important in
      vivo.

TI  - Conservation of structure and expression of the trithorax gene between Drosophila
      virilis and Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 113-22
AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster trithorax gene encodes several large RNAs which are
      expressed in complex patterns in the embryo. The D. virilis trithorax gene was
      isolated and sequenced. It produces a similar to D. melanogaster set of
      transcripts, and it encodes a protein that shows sequence similarity in several
      domains which are also conserved in human homologue, ALL-1/HRX. Previous
      experiments have suggested that a distinct expression domain of trithorax in the 
      posterior region of the embryo is required to maintain expression of the BX-C
      genes (Sedkov et al., 1994, Development 120, 1907-1917). At cellular blastoderm, 
      trithorax RNA expression in D. virilis embryos is also confined to the posterior 
      portion of the presumptive mesoderm. This finding supports the idea that the
      specific BX-C-related expression domain is an essential feature of the trithorax 
      gene.

TI  - Conserved alternative splicing patterns and splicing signals in the Drosophila
      sodium channel gene para.
PG  - 203-14
AB  - We cloned genomic DNA corresponding to the Drosophila virilis homologue of para, 
      a gene encoding a sodium channel alpha-subunit, and obtained many partial cDNA
      clones from embryos and adults. Para protein has been well conserved, and the
      optional elements at six different sites of alternative splicing in D.
      melanogaster are present in D. virilis, in addition to one new optional exon.
      Among 31 different splice-types observed in D. virilis, the stage-specific
      pattern of alternative splicing seen in D. melanogaster is also conserved.
      Comparison of genomic DNA sequence revealed three aspects that vary between
      alternatively and constitutively used exon sequences. Sixteen short blocks (10-75
      bp), the only recognizably conserved intron sequence, were disproportionately
      associated with alternatively used splice sites. Silent site substitutions were
      found much less frequently in alternative than constitutive exon elements, and
      the degree of match to the Drosophila splice site consensus tended to be lower at
      less frequently selected alternative splice junctions. This study shows that the 
      developmentally regulated variability of para products is highly conserved and
      therefore likely to be of functional significance and suggests that a variety of 
      different sequence-dependent mechanisms may regulate this pattern of alternative 
      splicing.

TI  - The segment-polarity gene fused is highly conserved in Drosophila.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - The segment polarity gene fused (fu) is involved in specification of positional
      information inside embryonic segments in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm). The
      predicted Fused (Fu) protein contains a serine/threonine kinase domain and a
      second domain with unknown function. We cloned and sequenced the fu homologous
      gene from Drosophila virilis (Dv) and made an interspecific DNA sequence
      comparison to identify regions that have been conserved during evolution.
      Comparison of the predicted amino acid (aa) sequences reveals two regions of
      strong homology, one corresponding to the kinase domain (268 aa), the other
      located in the third exon of the Dm fu gene, suggesting a functional importance
      for this region. Stretches of significantly conserved sequences are also observed
      in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Weak homology is seen in the intronic
      sequences although the adjacent exonic sequences are mostly conserved. These
      findings indicate a high conservation of the predicted Fu protein during the
      evolution of Drosophila.

TI  - Diverse transposable elements are mobilized in hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila
      virilis.
PG  - 8050-4
AB  - We describe a system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis in which at least
      four unrelated transposable elements are all mobilized following a dysgenic
      cross. The data are largely consistent with the superposition of at least three
      different systems of hybrid dysgenesis, each repressing a different transposable 
      element, which break down following the hybrid cross, possibly because they share
      a common pathway in the host. The data are also consistent with a mechanism in
      which mobilization of a single element triggers that of others, perhaps through
      chromosome breakage. The mobilization of multiple, unrelated elements in hybrid
      dysgenesis is reminiscent of McClintock's evidence [McClintock, B. (1955)
      Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 8, 58-74] for simultaneous mobilization of different
      transposable elements in maize.

TI  - A relatively small 5' regulatory region of esterase S gene of Drosophila virilis 
      determines the specific expression as revealed in transgenic experiments.
PG  - 302-10
AB  - Expression of the esterase S gene of Drosophila virilis was studied in transgenic
      experiments. Truncated genomic copy of this gene including 400 bp of 5'
      regulatory region was integrated into the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. The 
      products of the transferred gene were detected. It was found that strict temporal
      and tissue specificity of the esterase S gene expression is conserved in
      transformed flies. The results suggest that this specificity is evidently
      determined by the regulatory region of the esterase S gene and controlled by cis 
      mechanism.

TI  - The extra sex combs protein is highly conserved between Drosophila virilis and
      Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 225-32
AB  - Extra sex combs (esc) is one of the Polycomb Group genes, whose products are
      required for long term maintenance of the spatially restricted domains of
      homeotic gene expression initially established by the products of the
      segmentation genes. We recently showed that the esc protein contains five copies 
      of the WD motif, which in other proteins has been directly implicated in
      protein-protein interactions. Mutations affecting the WD repeats of the esc
      protein indicate that they are essential for its function as a repressor of the
      homeotic genes. We proposed that they may mediate interactions between esc and
      other Polycomb Group proteins, recruiting them to their target genes, perhaps by 
      additional interactions with transiently expressed repressors such as hunchback. 
      To further investigate the functional importance of the WD motifs and identify
      other functionally important regions of the esc protein, we have begun to
      determine its evolutionary conservation by characterizing the esc gene from
      Drosophila virilis, a distantly related Drosophila species. We show that the esc 
      protein is highly conserved between these species, particularly its WD motifs.
      Their high degree of conservation, particularly at positions which are not
      conserved in the WD consensus derived from alignment of all known WD motifs,
      suggests that each of the WD repeats in the esc protein is functionally
      specialized and that this specialization has been highly conserved during
      evolution. Its highly charged N-terminus exhibits the greatest divergence, but
      even these differences are conservative of its predicted physical properties.
      These observations suggest that the esc protein is functionally compact, nearly
      every residue making an important contribution to its function.

TI  - nanos is an evolutionarily conserved organizer of anterior-posterior polarity.
PG  - 1899-910
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, nanos functions as a localized determinant of
      posterior pattern. Nanos RNA is localized to the posterior pole of the maturing
      egg cell and encodes a protein that emanates from this localized source. Nanos
      acts as a translational repressor and thereby establishes a gradient of the
      morphogen Hunchback. Here we show that the mechanism by which nanos acts in
      Drosophila is a common developmental strategy in Dipteran insects. We used
      cytoplasmic transplantation assays to demonstrate that nanos activity is found in
      posterior poleplasm of five diverse Dipteran species. Genes homologous to nanos
      were identified from Drosophila virilis, the housefly Musca domestica, and the
      midge Chironomus samoensis. These genes encode RNAs that are each localized, like
      nanos, to the embryonic posterior pole. Most importantly, we demonstrate that
      these homologues can functionally substitute for nanos in D. melanogaster. These 
      results suggest that nanos acts in a similar pathway for axis determination in
      other insects. Comparison of the Nanos sequences reveals only 19% overall protein
      sequence similarity; high conservation of a novel zinc finger near the carboxy
      terminus of the protein defines a region critical for nanos gene function.

AB  - Activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was examined in adult flies from stress
      lines of Drosophila virilis resistant and nonresistant to heat and from their
      hybrids under heat stress and normal conditions. The resistant line was shown to 
      have higher enzyme activity and dominate for this character. Gene(s) controlling 
      the level of TH activity under normal conditions were not sex-linked. It was
      shown than 30-min heat stress caused a decrease in TH activity; with 120-min
      stress, the activity increased. A possible mechanism of these changes is
      discussed. In the nonresistant line, the TH activity does not change under heat
      stress; the line dominates at this trait. Gene(s) controlling the level of the
      enzyme activity under stress are not sex-linked.

      melanogaster.
PG  - 194-6
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster was transformed with the esterase S gene from Drosophila 
      virilis. This gene is strongly activated in ejaculatory bulbs of mature males of 
      Drosophila virilis. The closely related gene from Drosophila melanogaster is
      activated in ejaculatory ducts. The tissue- and stage-specific expression of
      incomplete genomic copy of the esterase S gene integrated into the Drosophila
      melanogaster genome is the same as in Drosophila virilis. These data show that
      tissue and stage specificity is determined by relatively small 5' regulatory
      region of the esterase S gene. The comparison between deduced amino-acid
      sequences of the esterase S of Drosophila virilis and esterase 6 of Drosophila
      melanogaster was performed. These sequences revealed 50% homology.

AB  - The metabolism of juvenile hormone (JH) in imagos of two Drosophila species (D.

      amount of protein. JH metabolism in males does not change after heat stress.
      Genetic analysis of differences in the activity of DPF-resistant JH esterase in
      stress-sensitive and stress-resistant strains of D. virilis was performed. The
      differences are controlled by one autosomal gene.

AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Gpdh gene from six taxa, D. virilis, D. lummei, D.
      novamexicana, D. a. americana, D. a. texana and D. ezoana, belonging to the
      virilis species group was determined to examine details of evolutionary change in
      the structure of the Gpdh gene. The Gpdh gene is comprised of one 5'
      non-translated region, eight exons, seven introns and three 3' non-translated
      regions. Exon/intron organization was identical in all the species examined, but 
      different from that of mammals. Interspecific nucleotide divergence in the entire
      Gpdh gene followed the common pattern: it was low in the exon, high in the intron
      and intermediate in the non-translated regions. The degree of nucleotide
      divergence differed within these regions, suggesting that selection exerts
      constraints differentially on nucleotide change of the Gpdh gene. A phylogenetic 
      tree of the virilis phylad constructed from nucleotide variation of total
      sequence was consistent with those obtained from other data.

TI  - Conservation of complex expression domains of the pdm-2 POU domain gene between
      Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 107-16
AB  - The closely linked pdm-1 and pdm-2 genes of Drosophila are expressed in complex
      patterns that suggest diverse roles in segmentation and nervous system
      development. A D. virilis pdm cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced. It shares
      sequence similarity with just the POU domain region of pdm-1, but shares
      extensive sequence similarity with the largest exon of pdm-2. In situ
      hybridization to D. virilis embryos shows that virtually all aspects of pdm-2
      expression are conserved between D. virilis and D. melanogaster. This includes
      initial expression in a gap gene-like posterior domain, expression in ectodermal 
      stripes during germ band extension, broad expression in the neurectoderm followed
      by limitation to discrete subsets of CNS cells, and expression in specific PNS
      neurons and support cells. The conservation of these expression domains supports 
      the idea that the pdm genes are important for a variety of cell fate decisions in
      Drosophila development.

TI  - [A comparative analysis of the expression of the betaEst2 gene in the ontogeny of
      the Drosophila virilis group].
PG  - 84-9
AB  - We studied expression of gene betaEst2 controlling synthesis of non-specific
      carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) in ontogenesis of Drosophila group virilis. It was 
      established that in all sibling species of this group, except D. lummei,
      beta-esterase is found at all developmental stages: in larvae, pupae, and imago. 
      In D. lummei beta-esterase is found at the imago stage only. Analysis of 17
      laboratory strains of D. lummei of various geographical origin has shown that the
      absence of the gene betaEst2 expression in larvae and pupae can be considered a
      species specific diagnostic feature. Comparison of esterase phenotypes in the
      progeny of crosses between D. lummei and other species has shown that the D.
      lummei gene is not expressed in hybrid larvae and pupae. Hence, species specific 
      expression of gene betaEst2 in ontogenesis of D. lummei is due to cis-acting
      regulatory system.

TI  - Induction of diaphorase-1 by dicoumarol in Drosophila virilis larvae.
PG  - 25-34
AB  - Drosophila diaphorase-1 (DIA-1) is an enzyme similar to mammalian DT-diaphorase
      and is inhibited in vitro by dicoumarol. However, a ten-fold increase in DIA-1
      activity was observed when third instar Drosophila virilis larvae were fed on a
      diet containing 0.1 M dicoumarol for 48 h. This induction was shown to be dose
      dependent and immunoprecipitation experiments with DIA-1 anti-serum demonstrated 
      an increase in the DIA-1 protein level in dicoumarol-treated larvae. The
      induction of DIA1 by dicoumarol was found to be blocked by actinomycin D, which
      suggests a transcriptional mechanism of regulation. The opposite effect of
      dicoumarol on DIA-1 in vitro vs. in vivo suggests that a metabolic conversion
      takes place after the ingestion of this compound by D. virilis larvae.

TI  - Enhancer of rudimentaryp1, e(r)p1, a highly conserved enhancer of the rudimentary
      gene.
PG  - 1163-70
AB  - A hybrid dysgenesis-induced mutation, enhancer of rudimentaryp1 (e(r)p1), is a
      recessive enhancer of a weak rudimentary mutant phenotype in Drosophila
      melanogaster. The e(r) gene was cloned using P element tagging and localized to
      region 8B on the X chromosome. It encodes a 1.0-kb and a 1.2-kb transcript. The
      1.0-kb transcript is present in both adult males and females, while the 1.2-kb
      transcript is predominantly found in females. The difference in the lengths of
      the two e(r) transcripts is caused by two different polyadenylation sites spaced 
      228 bp apart. The amounts of both of these transcripts are drastically reduced in
      the e(r)p1 mutant. The P element in e(r)p1 is inserted in the 5'-untranslated
      leader region near the start of transcription. It may be producing its effect by 
      suppressing transcription and/or by providing transcription termination and
      polyadenylation signals. The putative e(r) protein is 104 amino acids in length
      and bears no striking resemblance to protein sequences in GenBank or PIR. While
      its biochemical function is unknown at this time, sequence analysis indicates
      that the e(r) protein is highly conserved and, presumably, functionally very
      important. The amino acid sequences of the D. melanogaster and the Drosophila
      virilis proteins are 95% identical.

TI  - Cloning of a structural and functional homolog of the circadian clock gene period
      from the giant silkmoth Antheraea pernyi.
PG  - 1167-76
AB  - The period (per) gene of Drosophila plays an important role in circadian clock
      function. Interestingly, homologs of per have not been cloned outside of dipteran
      species. Using a PCR strategy, we now report the cloning of the cDNA of a per
      homolog from the silkmoth Antheraea pernyi. The cDNA encodes a protein of 849
      amino acids, which shows highest identity (39%) with the per protein of
      Drosophila virilis. Stretches of high identity between moth and fly proteins are 
      in the amino terminus, the PAS region, and the region surrounding the site of the
      per mutation in Drosophila. Moth per homolog mRNA levels exhibit a prominent
      circadian variation in adult heads, and per protein antibodies show a pronounced 
      variation of per antigen staining in photoreceptor nuclei. With sequence
      information derived from moth and flies, per-like cDNA fragments were readily
      cloned by PCR from other moth species and a third insect order.

TI  - Molecular cloning of the Drosophila virilis larval glue protein gene Lgp-3 and
      its comparative analysis with other Drosophila glue protein genes.
PG  - 576-80
AB  - DNA comprising the larval glue protein gene Lgp-3 of Drosophila virilis was
      isolated from a lambda genomic and a cDNA library. The transcription start site, 
      two polyadenylation sites and the boundaries of the single intron were
      determined. An open reading frame encoding 379 amino acids was found. At the DNA 
      level the presence of similar introns and three conserved sequence motifs in the 
      proximal promoters suggest that the gene is related to those of the D. virilis
      lgp-1 and the D. melanogaster sgs-3, -7 and -8 glue proteins. Their common
      ancestry is also substantiated by the comparisons of the deduced amino acid
      sequences and the profiles of hydropathic indices, which reveal striking
      similarities of the N- and C-termini and of the central repeat domains, although 
      the lengths and the primary structures of the proteins diverged considerably
      during 60 million years of separate evolution of the two Drosophila species.

TI  - Comparison of the neuralized genes of Drosophila virilis and D. melanogaster.
PG  - 840-7
AB  - The neurogenic gene neuralized of Drosophila melanogaster is thought to play a
      role in the determination of cell fate in the embryonic nervous system as well as
      other tissues during development. To determine which sequences within the
      neuralized gene encode functionally important domains, we have initiated an
      interspecific comparison of the neuralized gene of D. virilis and D.
      melanogaster. In this study we show that several motifs that we have previously
      identified in the neuralized protein of D. melanogaster are conserved in D.
      virilis. These include a putative nuclear localization signal, a homeodomain
      similarity region, and a zinc finger motif. In contrast, a helix-turn-helix motif
      with structural similarity to those identified as DNA-binding regions of
      bacterial repressors is deleted. These results demonstrate that it is possible to
      identify key functional regions of the neuralized protein by an interspecific
      comparison.

TI  - Characterization of the highly conserved TFIIA small subunit from Drosophila
      melanogaster.
PG  - 24361-6
AB  - TFIIA is a general transcription factor that modulates class II transcription
      initiation in vitro by functionally and physically interacting with TFIID or the 
      derived TATA-binding protein (TBP). TFIIA was previously purified from human,
      bovine, rat, and yeast sources and has recently been identified in association
      with TFIID in Drosophila. Here, we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding the
      12.5-kDa subunit of TFIIA from Drosophila melanogaster (dTFIIA-S) and the
      identification of a partial dTFIIA-S gene in Drosophila virilis. The deduced
      amino acid sequence of dTFIIA-S indicates a high degree of homology to the small 
      TFIIA subunit from yeast and to a partial TFIIA-S cDNA identified in rice. A
      hybrid TFIIA consisting of recombinant dTFIIA-S and the recombinant human
      TFIIA/alpha gene product mimics natural TFIIA activity in a TBP-dependent DNA
      binding assay. The promoter complex formed with this hybrid TFIIA depends upon
      the TATA element and can be efficiently incorporated into a higher order
      preinitiation complex upon addition of TFIIB. The presence of dTFIIA-S within the
      TBP-TFIIA-promoter complex was demonstrated using anti-dTFIIA-S antiserum.
      Finally, the ability of recombinant dTFIIA-S to reconstitute transcriptionally
      active TFIIA was demonstrated in a well defined human transcription system.

TI  - Drosophila virilis oskar transgenes direct body patterning but not pole cell
      formation or maintenance of mRNA localization in D. melanogaster.
PG  - 2027-37
AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster gene oskar is required for both posterior body
      patterning and germline formation in the early embryo; precisely how oskar
      functions is unknown. The oskar transcript is localized to the posterior pole of 
      the developing oocyte, and oskar mRNA and protein are maintained at the pole
      through early embryogenesis. The posterior maintenance of oskar mRNA is dependent
      upon the presence of oskar protein. We have cloned and characterized the
      Drosophila virilis oskar homologue, virosk, and examined its activity as a
      transgene in Drosophila melanogaster flies. We find that the cis-acting mRNA
      localization signals are conserved, although the virosk transcript also
      transiently accumulates at novel intermediate sites. The virosk protein, however,
      shows substantial differences from oskar: while virosk is able to rescue body
      patterning in a D. melanogaster oskar- background, it is impaired in both mRNA
      maintenance and pole cell formation. Furthermore, virosk induces a dominant
      maternal-effect lethality when introduced into a wild-type background, and
      interferes with the posterior maintenance of the endogenous oskar transcript in
      early embryogenesis. Our data suggest that virosk protein is unable to anchor at 
      the posterior pole of the early embryo; this defect could account for all of the 
      characteristics of virosk mentioned above. Our observations support a model in
      which oskar protein functions both by nucleating the factors necessary for the
      activation of the posterior body patterning determinant and the germ cell
      determinant, and by anchoring these factors to the posterior pole of the embryo. 
      While the posterior body patterning determinant need not be correctly localized
      to provide body patterning activity, the germ cell determinant may need to be
      highly concentrated adjacent to the cortex in order to direct pole cell
      formation.

TI  - Components acting in localization of bicoid mRNA are conserved among Drosophila
      species.
PG  - 521-30
AB  - Substantial insights into basic strategies for embryonic body patterning have
      been obtained from genetic analyses of Drosophila melanogaster. This knowledge
      has been used in evolutionary comparisons to ask if genes and functions are
      conserved. To begin to ask how highly conserved are the mechanisms of mRNA
      localization, a process crucial to Drosophila body patterning, we have focused on
      the localization of bcd mRNA to the anterior pole of the embryo. Here we consider
      two components involved in that process: the exuperantia (exu) gene, required for
      an early step in localization; and the cis-acting signal that directs bcd mRNA
      localization. First, we use the cloned D. melanogaster exu gene to identify the
      exu genes from Drosophila virilis and Drosophila pseudoobscura and to isolate
      them for comparisons at the structural and functional levels. Surprisingly, D.
      pseudoobscura has two closely related exu genes, while D. melanogaster and D.
      virilis have only one each. When expressed in D. melanogaster ovaries, the D.
      virilis exu gene and one of the D. pseudoobscura exu genes can substitute for the
      endogenous exu gene in supporting localization of bcd mRNA, demonstrating that
      function is conserved. Second, we reevaluate the ability of the D. pseudoobscura 
      bcd mRNA localization signal to function in D. melanogaster. In contrast to a
      previous report, we find that function is retained. Thus, among these Drosophila 
      species there is substantial conservation of components acting in mRNA
      localization, and presumably the mechanisms underlying this process.

TI  - Songs produced by the females of the Drosophila virilis group of species.
PG  - 263-72
AB  - Females of the Drosophila virilis group of species may vibrate their wings during
      courtship producing songs consisting of trains of successive sound pulses (pulse 
      song) or sinusoidal hums (sine song). In the present study we describe these
      songs and study their role in courtship using a transition analysis. To find out 
      which songs should be classified as pulse songs and which ones as sine songs, we 
      studied the inheritance of different song types in interspecific F1 hybrids. In
      only a few species did the females produce large quantities of song in successful
      courtships. The males' reactions to female songs varied from licking and singing 
      to stopping the courtship. Pulse trains with short and long intervals between
      successive pulses appeared to be different forms of the pulse song, while sine
      song (sinusoidal hums) was inherited independently of the pulse song.

TI  - The bipartite D. melanogaster twist promoter is reorganized in D. virilis.
PG  - 41-53
AB  - The pivotal role of twist in mesoderm determination in the Drosophila embryo
      depends upon two processes--the transcriptional activation of twist in the
      ventrally located mesodermal anlage and the regulation of downstream gene
      expression by the twist transcription factor. To elucidate the molecular
      mechanisms involved in these processes, we have compared both the coding and
      regulatory regions of the twist genes from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila
      virilis. Within the coding region, the basic-helix-loop-helix DNA binding and
      dimerization motif is highly conserved, consistent with the functional importance
      of this domain. A comparison of the transcriptional regulatory regions reveals a 
      high degree of conservation in the more distal of the two ventral activator
      regions that have been mapped in the twist 5' flanking region. On the other hand,
      the more proximal ventral activator region is absent at the corresponding
      position in the D. virilis twist gene. Instead, there is a region in the second
      intron of the D. virilis gene that resembles the proximal element of the D.
      melanogaster gene, in that it consists of little more than a series of whole and 
      half binding sites for the dorsal morphogen. In transformation experiments, the
      intronic D. virilis element directs an expression pattern that is
      indistinguishable from that directed by the D. melanogaster proximal VAR. Thus,
      the twi genes from these two species appear to have evolved enhancer elements
      with very similar structural and functional properties. These findings suggest
      that apparently redundant spatially regulated enhancer elements may each play
      essential roles in fine tuning the level and/or pattern of gene expression.

TI  - [Tv1--a new family of Drosophila virilis retrotransposons].
PG  - 437-44
AB  - A new method for isolation and cloning of functionally active retrotransposons
      was proposed and tested. The method is based on the hypothesis about the
      universal character of retrotransposition through reverse transcription. A new
      retrotransposon family (Tvl) was coned from the Drosophila virilis genome. A
      full-length Tvl copy was 7 kb. The cell line under consideration contained
      500-1000 Tvl copies per cell, i.e., it accounted for 0.3% of the genome. Tvl RNA,
      detected in the cell culture, was almost absent in cells of adult flies. A 7-kb
      polyadenylated RNA was the main transcript of Tvl. Extrachromosomal circular and 
      linear Tvl copies were cloned and characterized. The following features of Tvl
      structural organization were studied: (1) element was flanked by perfect direct
      repeats of 453 bp size (long terminal repeats, LTRs); (2) element sequences
      adjacent to the LTRs were homologous to binding sites of primer serine tRNA and
      the polypurine blocks of retrotransposons 17.6 and 297; and (3) expected
      transcription of LTRs occurred as for known retrotransposons, --producing RNA
      with a direct terminal repeat.

TI  - Synonymous codon usage in Drosophila melanogaster: natural selection and
      translational accuracy.
PG  - 927-35
AB  - I present evidence that natural selection biases synonymous codon usage to
      enhance the accuracy of protein synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Since the
      fitness cost of a translational misincorporation will depend on how the amino
      acid substitution affects protein function, selection for translational accuracy 
      predicts an association between codon usage in DNA and functional constraint at
      the protein level. The frequency of preferred codons is significantly higher at
      codons conserved for amino acids than at nonconserved codons in 38 genes compared
      between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis or Drosophila pseudoobscura (Z =
      5.93, P < 10(-6)). Preferred codon usage is also significantly higher in putative
      zinc-finger and homeodomain regions than in the rest of 28 D. melanogaster
      transcription factor encoding genes (Z = 8.38, P < 10(-6)). Mutational
      alternatives (within-gene differences in mutation rates, amino acid changes
      altering codon preference states, and doublet mutations at adjacent bases) do not
      appear to explain this association between synonymous codon usage and amino acid 
      constraint.

TI  - Evolutionary conservation of the structure and expression of alternatively
      spliced Ultrabithorax isoforms from Drosophila.
PG  - 965-77
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, alternatively spliced mRNAs from the homeotic gene
      Ultrabithorax (Ubx) encode a family of structurally distinct homeoprotein
      isoforms. The developmentally regulated expression patterns of these isoforms
      suggest that they have specialized stage- and tissue-specific functions. To
      evaluate the functional importance of UBX isoform diversity and gain clues to the
      mechanism that regulates processing of Ubx RNAs, we have investigated whether the
      Ubx RNAs of other insects undergo similar alternative splicing. We have isolated 
      and characterized Ubx cDNA fragments from D. melanogaster, Drosophila
      pseudoobscura, Drosophila hydei and Drosophila virilis, species separated by as
      much as 60 million years of evolution, and have found that three aspects of Ubx
      RNA processing have been conserved. (1) These four species exhibit identical
      patterns of optional exon use in a region adjacent to the homeodomain. (2) These 
      four species produce the same family of UBX protein isoforms with identical amino
      acid sequences in the optional exons, even though the common amino-proximal
      region has undergone substantial divergence. The nucleotide sequences of the
      optional exons, including third positions of rare codons, have also been
      conserved strongly, suggesting functional constraints that are not limited to
      coding potential. (3) The tissue- and stage-specific patterns of expression of
      different UBX isoforms are identical among these Drosophila species, indicating
      that the developmental regulation of the alternative splicing events has also
      been conserved. These findings argue for an important role of alternative
      splicing in Ubx function. We discuss the implications of these results for models
      of UBX protein function and the mechanism of alternative splicing.

TI  - Regulatory and coding regions of the segmentation gene hunchback are functionally
      conserved between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 105-15
AB  - The segmentation gene hunchback (hb) is involved in setting up the
      anterior-posterior axis of the Drosophila embryo. It is expressed maternally and 
      zygotically and it plays a key role in integrating the effects of the anterior
      and posterior maternal systems. The hb gene from D. virilis has previously been
      cloned and was shown to be well conserved in its coding region, but less so in
      its upstream region which shows a more patchy pattern of conserved and diverged
      sequences. This work deals with the functional conservation of hb between the two
      species. We have mapped two additional regulatory elements for the expression of 
      hb in the early embryo, namely the enhancer for the maternal expression and the
      enhancer region for the late blastoderm expression. Fragments containing these
      two elements, the previously identified bicoid dependent element for the early
      blastoderm expression of hb and the coding region were taken from D. virilis and 
      tested in the D. melanogaster background. We find that all enhancer elements as
      well as the coding region are functionally conserved between the two species.
      Comparison of the upstream sequences that include the enhancer region for the
      late blastoderm expression reveal seven highly conserved blocks. Some of these
      contain consensus binding sites for transregulatory factors that are likely to
      control the respective expression domains.

TI  - Secondary courtship songs and inhibitory songs of Drosophila virilis-group males.
PG  - 85-94
AB  - The males of all Drosophila virilis-group species produce primary courtship song;
      and the males of four of these species also provide secondary courtship song when
      courting a female. The amount of secondary song and the courtship phase at which 
      it is produced vary according to the species. D. lummei males produce secondary
      song consisting of successive 12-ms-long sound pulses with 70-ms-long intervals
      between pulses. D. borealis males produce short and dense pulse trains and D.
      littoralis and D. flavomontana males produce single sound pulses of a long
      duration (80-160 ms). The males of all species produce pulse-structured
      inhibitory song when they are courted by another male. In the secondary and
      inhibitory songs of interspecific hybrids, short and dense pulse trains of parent
      species break into pulse song with long interpulse intervals. This suggests that 
      songs consisting of short and dense pulse trains and pulse songs with long
      interpulse intervals are just different modes of the same song. Sine songs (long 
      sound pulses) seem to be inherited independently of pulse song.

TI  - spalt encodes an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger protein of novel structure 
      which provides homeotic gene function in the head and tail region of the
      Drosophila embryo.
PG  - 168-79
AB  - The region specific homeotic gene spalt (sal) of Drosophila melanogaster promotes
      the specification of terminal pattern elements as opposed to segments in the
      trunk. Our results show that the previously reported sal transcription unit was
      misidentified. Based on P-element mediated germ line transformation and DNA
      sequence analysis of sal mutant alleles, we identified the transcription unit
      that carries sal function. sal is located close to the misidentified
      transcription unit, and it is expressed in similar temporal and spatial patterns 
      during embryogenesis. The sal gene encodes a zinc finger protein of novel
      structure composed of three widely spaced 'double zinc finger' motifs of
      internally conserved sequences and a single zinc finger motif of different
      sequence. Antibodies produced against the sal protein show that sal is first
      expressed at the blastoderm stage and later in restricted areas of the embryonic 
      nervous system as well as in the developing trachea. The antibodies detect sal
      homologous proteins in corresponding spatial and temporal patterns in the embryos
      of related insect species. Sequence analysis of the sal gene of Drosophila
      virilis, a species which is phylogenetically separated by approximately 60
      million years, suggests that the sal function is conserved during evolution,
      consistent with its proposed role in head formation during arthropod evolution.

TI  - Domain mapping of tube, a protein essential for dorsoventral patterning of the
      Drosophila embryo.
PG  - 3449-58
AB  - The tube protein plays an essential role in the signal transduction pathway that 
      establishes dorsoventral polarity in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo.
      Characterization of each of four tube mutants revealed a substitution or
      insertion in the amino-terminal half of the protein. This portion of the tube
      protein is also evolutionarily conserved, as demonstrated by isolation and
      sequencing of the Drosophila virilis tube gene. Moreover, RNA microinjection
      assays and germline transformation experiments demonstrated that the
      amino-terminal domain alone provides substantial levels of gene function:
      constructs encoding only the amino-terminal domain restore dorsoventral polarity 
      to embryos lacking any maternal tube function. In the carboxyterminal domain,
      sequence conservation is concentrated in the five octapeptide repeats. Although
      the repeat-containing domain by itself provides no rescue of the tube maternal
      effect phenotype, it is necessary for wild-type levels of tube activity. This
      domain is thus likely to play an ancillary role in axis formation.

AB  - An entire copy of 1731, a Drosophila melanogaster retrotransposon, was tagged by 
      fusing in frame its putative gag gene with the reporter LacZ sequence. The high
      transfection efficiency of Drosophila virilis cells added to the absence of 1731 
      in their genome allowed, by combining histochemical staining and immunological
      detections, the demonstration of the translation of the 1731 gag gene. The gag
      protein is gathered in virus-like particles. Its occurrence in nuclei is
      consistent with a nuclear localization signal. The expression of the sense
      construction was inhibited by cotransfections with its antisense homologue.

TI  - MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF THE DROSOPHILA VIRILIS SPECIES GROUP AS ASSESSED BY
      RATE TESTS FOR NATURAL SELECTION ON QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERS.
PG  - 1240-1254
LID - 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb02150.x [doi]
AB  - Two rate tests for assessing natural selection on quantitative traits are
      discussed for their usefulness in macroevolutionary and adaptational studies. The
      underlying assumptions and parameter estimation for the constant-heritability
      (CH) and mutation-drift-equilibrium (MDE) models, which are the bases for these
      tests, are discussed. The purpose of these rate tests is to determine whether
      morphological change has occurred either too fast to be explained by neutral
      drift, which suggests directional selection, or too slow, which suggests
      stabilizing selection. Previous formulations of these rate tests have ignored the
      phylogenetic component. Several models of evolution are considered to help
      account for phylogeny in the context of rate tests. The MDE rate test for
      stabilizing selection was performed on nine morphological characters among
      several species of the Drosophila virilis species group. These tests can be
      interpreted to suggest that stabilizing selection has probably been a major
      factor in producing the observed similarity among the Drosophila species
      examined.

TI  - Regulation of tissue-specific expression of the esterase S gene in Drosophila
      virilis.
PG  - 3545-51
AB  - The esterase S gene (estS) of Drosophila virilis is specifically expressed in the
      ejaculatory bulbs of males. Its sequencing shows similarities between estS
      product and other esterases of different origin. The transcription of estS in
      ejaculatory bulbs is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than in other tissues 
      of males. Two promoters, P1 (distal) and P2 (proximal), and two different
      transcripts were identified. The promoter P2 is used much more efficiently, and
      in a stringent, tissue-specific manner. The transcription from P1 takes place in 
      different tissues and stages of development of D. virilis. However, the mRNA
      transcribed from P1 seems to be inactive in translation as there are three
      open-reading frames (ORF) between P1 and P2, which may block the translation in
      P1 initiated mRNA. Insertion of sequence containing the three ORFs into the 5'
      untranslated region of the CAT gene strongly inhibited expression of CAT. Point
      mutations destroying the three ORFs completely eliminate the inhibitory effect.
      Hence tissue-specific expression of the estS gene may depend on control at the
      level of transcription, promoter selection and translation.

TI  - Codon usage bias and base composition of nuclear genes in Drosophila.
PG  - 847-58
AB  - The nuclear genes of Drosophila evolve at various rates. This variation seems to 
      correlate with codon-usage bias. In order to elucidate the determining factors of
      the various evolutionary rates and codon-usage bias in the Drosophila nuclear
      genome, we compared patterns of codon-usage bias with base compositions of exons 
      and introns. Our results clearly show the existence of selective constraints at
      the translational level for synonymous (silent) sites and, on the other hand, the
      neutrality or near neutrality of long stretches of nucleotide sequence within
      noncoding regions. These features were found for comparisons among nuclear genes 
      in a particular species (Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura and
      Drosophila virilis) as well as in a particular gene (alcohol dehydrogenase) among
      different species in the genus Drosophila. The patterns of evolution of
      synonymous sites in Drosophila are more similar to those in the prokaryotes than 
      they are to those in mammals. If a difference in the level of expression of each 
      gene is a main reason for the difference in the degree of selective constraint,
      the evolution of synonymous sites of Drosophila genes would be sensitive to the
      level of expression among genes and would change as the level of expression
      becomes altered in different species. Our analysis verifies these predictions and
      also identifies additional selective constraints at the translational level in
      Drosophila.

TI  - The interaction of bride of sevenless with sevenless is conserved between
      Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 5047-51
AB  - An inductive interaction between the sevenless (sev) transmembrane tyrosine
      kinase receptor and the bride of sevenless (boss) transmembrane ligand is
      required for the development of the R7 photoreceptor neuron in the compound eye
      of Drosophila melanogaster. The boss protein is proposed to contain a large
      N-terminal extracellular domain, seven transmembrane segments, and a C-terminal
      cytoplasmic tail. The boss protein from Drosophila virilis (bossvir) retains
      strong amino acid identity with loss from D. melanogaster (bossmel): 73% identity
      in the N-terminal extracellular domain and 91% identity in the
      seven-transmembrane domain, including the cytoplasmic tail. By using
      P-element-mediated DNA transformation, the bossmel and bossvir genes were shown
      to rescue the D. melanogaster boss1 mutation. The expression of bossvir protein
      in D. melanogaster is indistinguishable from that of bossmel protein. Noncoding
      sequences which may regulate boss expression were identified based on their
      conservation during evolution. The predicted sev protein from D. virilis (sevvir)
      was previously shown to be 63% identical to sev from D. melanogaster (sevmel). A 
      chimeric gene, (sevvir/mel), encoding the extracellular domain of sevvir and the 
      cytoplasmic domain of sevmel rescues the D. melanogaster sevd2 mutation through
      interaction with either bossvir or bossmel.

AB  - The results of genetic analysis of the differences in dopamine (DA) content
      between two lines of Drosophila virilis in response to heat stress are presented.
      The gene(s) controlling the differences in DA content under normal conditions is 
      located on the X-chromosome, and the gene(s) controlling the differences in
      responsiveness of DA system to stress was found to be autosomal. By means of
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was also examined phenoloxidase activity in
      these lines under normal conditions and short-term heat stress (60 min, 38
      degrees C). Of the five phenol oxidase fractions identified, three were major,
      A1, A2 and A3 components, and two appeared occasionally. It seems likely that A1 
      is monophenol oxidase and A2 is diphenol oxidase. It was shown that neither mono,
      nor diphenol oxidase activities change under heat stress. It was found that D.
      virilis lines 147 and 101 differ in diphenol oxidase activity under normal
      conditions. Genetic analysis of these differences revealed that they are
      controlled by a single gene (or a group of closely linked genes). The gene
      controlling diphenol oxidase activity in D. virilis is located on the
      X-chromosome.

TI  - An intraspecific gene duplication polymorphism of the urate oxidase gene of
      Drosophila virilis: a genetic and molecular analysis.
PG  - 635-46
AB  - Nineteen strains of Drosophila virilis from diverse geographic locations were
      examined by genetic and molecular analyses, revealing (a) 12 strains with a
      single copy of the urate oxidase (UO) gene per haploid genome and (b) 7 strains
      with a tandem duplication of the UO locus. The D. virilis strains with the UO
      duplication appear to have identical restriction maps of this region, implying
      either a single origin for the duplication or several similar events occurring at
      a hot spot. On the basis of the location of the duplication breakpoints and the
      restriction sites flanking these breakpoints, this duplication probably arose
      through nonhomologous recombination involving either a breakage and rejoining
      event or replication slippage. because documented cases of intraspecific gene
      duplication polymorphism are rare, the D. virilis UO duplication will be useful
      in identifying the molecular event giving rise to a gene duplication.

TI  - A combined molecular and cytogenetic approach to genome evolution in Drosophila
      using large-fragment DNA cloning.
PG  - 253-66
AB  - Methods of genome analysis, including the cloning and manipulation of large
      fragments of DNA, have opened new strategies for uniting molecular evolutionary
      genetics with chromosome evolution. We have begun the development of a physical
      map of the genome of Drosophila virilis based on large DNA fragments cloned in
      bacteriophage P1. A library of 10,080 P1 clones with average insert sizes of 65.8
      kb, containing approximately 3.7 copies of the haploid genome of D. virilis, has 
      been constructed and characterized. Approximately 75% of the clones have inserts 
      exceeding 50 kb, and approximately 25% have inserts exceeding 80 kb. A sample of 
      186 randomly selected clones was mapped by in situ hybridization with the
      salivary gland chromosomes. A method for identifying D. virilis clones containing
      homologs of D. melanogaster genes has also been developed using hybridization
      with specific probes obtained from D. melanogaster by means of the polymerase
      chain reaction. This method proved successful for nine of ten genes and resulted 
      in the recovery of 14 clones. The hybridization patterns of a sample of P1 clones
      containing repetitive DNA were also determined. A significant fraction of these
      clones hybridizes to multiple euchromatic sites but not to the chromocenter,
      which is a pattern of hybridization that is very rare among clones derived from
      D. melanogaster. The materials and methods described will make it possible to
      carry out a direct study of molecular evolution at the level of chromosome
      structure and organization as well as at the level of individual genes.

TI  - Functional conservation of a glucose-repressible amylase gene promoter from
      Drosophila virilis in Drosophila melanogaster.
PG  - 234-42
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of the alpha-amylase gene 
      is repressed by dietary glucose in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we show that
      the alpha-amylase gene of a distantly related species, D. virilis, is also
      subject to glucose repression. Moreover, the cloned amylase gene of D. virilis is
      shown to be glucose repressible when it is transiently expressed in D.
      melanogaster larvae. This cross-species, functional conservation is mediated by a
      330-bp promoter region of the D. virilis amylase gene. These results indicate
      that the promoter elements required for glucose repression are conserved between 
      distantly related Drosophila species. A sequence comparison between the amylase
      genes of D. virilis and D. melanogaster shows that the promoter sequences diverge
      to a much greater degree than the coding sequences. The amylase promoters of the 
      two species do, however, share small clusters of sequence similarity, suggesting 
      that these conserved cis-acting elements are sufficient to control the
      glucose-regulated expression of the amylase gene in the genus Drosophila.

TI  - Analysis of a fushi tarazu autoregulatory element: multiple sequence elements
      contribute to enhancer activity.
PG  - 1111-9
AB  - Regulatory sequences or factors involved in the regulation of target genes of
      Drosophila homeodomain proteins are largely unknown. Here, we identify sequence
      elements that are involved in the function of the fushi tarazu (ftz)
      autoregulatory element AE, a direct in vivo target of the homeodomain protein
      ftz. A systematic deletion analysis of AE in transgenic embryos defines multiple 
      elements that are redundantly involved in enhancer activity. Sequences juxtaposed
      to ftz binding sites are not strictly required for enhancer function. Several
      sequence motifs are conserved in other developmentally regulated genes of
      Drosophila melanogaster and in the AE homologue of Drosophila virilis. The D.
      virilis AE is functional in D. melanogaster. The sequence motifs identified here 
      are candidate elements contributing to the target specificity of the homeodomain 
      protein ftz.

TI  - Characterization of downstream elements in a Raf-1 pathway.
PG  - 858-62
AB  - At the poles of the Drosophila embryo, cell fate is established by a pathway that
      begins with the activation of a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (the torso
      gene product); this then leads to activation of a serine/threonine kinase
      (Drosophila Raf-1). Activated Raf-1 then leads, by an undefined mechanism, to the
      transcriptional activation of the tailless (tll) gene; the tll gene product,
      itself a transcription factor, subsequently regulates the expression of an array 
      of target genes. To further define this pathway, we have utilized sequence
      comparison between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis to identify
      conserved elements in the tll promoter region. As assessed by DNase I
      footprinting and promoter dissection experiments, two of these elements are
      potential regulatory targets of Raf-1-activated transcription factors. Sequence
      comparison also reveals that the unique residues in the DNA-binding domain of the
      tll protein, the next component in the pathway, are conserved. One of these
      residues, the alanine after the last cysteine in the first zinc finger, may be
      responsible for part of the difference between the tll protein DNA binding site
      and the closely related half-site of the retinoid/estrogen receptors. Consistent 
      with the rapid turnover of the tll protein, it contains a PEST sequence (rich in 
      proline, glutamate and aspartate, serine, and threonine) that is also conserved.

TI  - Conservation of regulatory elements controlling hairy pair-rule stripe formation.
PG  - 585-96
AB  - The hairy (h) gene is one of two pair-rule loci whose striped expression is
      directly regulated by combinations of gap proteins acting through discrete
      upstream regulatory fragments, which span several kilobases. We have undertaken a
      comparative study of the molecular biology of h pair-rule expression in order to 
      identify conserved elements in this complex regulatory system, which should
      provide important clues concerning the mechanism of stripe formation. A molecular
      comparison of the h locus in Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster
      reveals a conserved overall arrangement of the upstream regulatory elements that 
      control individual pair-rule stripes. We demonstrate that upstream fragments from
      D. virilis will direct the proper expression of stripes in D. melanogaster,
      indicating that these are true functional homologs of the stripe-producing D.
      melanogaster regulatory elements, and that the network of trans-acting proteins
      that act upon these regulatory elements is highly conserved. We also demonstrate 
      that the spatial relationships between specific h stripes and selected gap
      proteins are highly conserved. We find several tracts of extensive nucleotide
      sequence conservation within homologous stripe-specific regulatory fragments,
      which have facilitated the identification of functional subelements within the D.
      melanogaster regulatory fragment for h stripe 5. Some of the conserved nucleotide
      tracts within this regulatory fragment contain consensus binding sites for
      potential trans-regulatory (gap and other) proteins, while many appear devoid of 
      known binding sites. This comparative approach, coupled with the analysis of
      reporter gene expression in gap mutant embryos suggests that the Kr and gt
      proteins establish the anterior and posterior borders of h stripe 5,
      respectively, through spatial repression. Other, as yet unidentified, proteins
      are certain to play a role in stripe activation, presumably acting through other 
      conserved sequence tracts.

TI  - Heterochromatin protein 1, a known suppressor of position-effect variegation, is 
      highly conserved in Drosophila.
PG  - 6067-74
AB  - The Su(var)205 gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes heterochromatin protein 1 
      (HP1), a protein located preferentially within beta-heterochromatin. Mutation of 
      this gene has been associated with dominant suppression of position-effect
      variegation. We have cloned and sequenced the gene encoding HP1 from Drosophila
      virilis, a distantly related species. Comparison of the predicted amino acid
      sequence with Drosophila melanogaster HP1 shows two regions of strong homology,
      one near the N-terminus (57/61 amino acids identical) and the other near the
      C-terminus (62/68 amino acids identical) of the protein. Little homology is seen 
      in the 5' and 3' untranslated portions of the gene, as well as in the intronic
      sequences, although intron/exon boundaries are generally conserved. A comparison 
      of the deduced amino acid sequences of HP1-like proteins from other species shows
      that the cores of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains have been conserved from 
      insects to mammals. The high degree of conservation suggests that these N- and
      C-terminal domains could interact with other macromolecules in the formation of
      the condensed structure of heterochromatin.

PG  - 523-31
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of 1731, a retrotransposon cloned from the genome of
      Drosophila melanogaster, reveals a structural similarity with the proviral form
      of the retroviruses including a pol-like gene containing a putative
      reverse-transcriptase(RT)-coding sequence. Diverse parts of that sequence were
      subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It has been demonstrated that the
      expression of the RT-like sequence, when translated, gives rise to peptides
      displaying enzyme activity characteristic of a true RT enzyme. In addition,
      rabbit antisera directed against such recombinant proteins allowed us to detect
      an immunoreactive protein of around 110 kDa, which was only present in D.
      melanogaster cell lines, but not in cells derived from Drosophila virilis or
      Drosophila hydei, whose genomes do not bear the 1731 element. This protein is
      expected to correspond to a non-processed pol-gene translated product and
      cosediments with virus-like particles exhibiting RT activity.

TI  - Comparative studies of Drosophila Antennapedia genes.
PG  - 453-69
AB  - The Antennapedia (Antp) homeotic gene of Drosophila melanogaster controls cell
      fates and pattern formation in the epidermis, nervous system and mesoderm of
      thoracic segments. Its expression is controlled at the levels of transcription,
      alternative RNA splicing, polyadenylation and translation. Two nested Antp
      transcription units extend over 103 kb and produce sixteen different transcripts.
      We have compared the Antp genes of Drosophila virilis, Drosophila subobscura and 
      D. melanogaster to determine which structural features are conserved and
      therefore may be important to the gene's function. The overall gene structures
      are similar. There are many conserved sequence blocks throughout the large
      introns, at least 15 kb upstream of the first promoter, and at least 3 kb
      downstream of the last polyadenylation site. Intron and exon sequence
      conservation around alternative splice sites indicates that alternative protein
      coding forms may also be conserved. Protein coding potential is perfectly
      conserved around the C-terminal homeodomain, well conserved in the N-terminal
      region, and more variable in the middle. The large size of the Antp gene may
      reflect a large number of control elements necessary for appropriate Antp protein
      expression. The conservation of transcript complexity suggests functional
      requirements for the different protein forms.

AB  - Significant effects of X-ray treatment on the increase in the number of
      phenotypic variations, two visible mutations, and chromosome aberrations were
      found in the progeny of irradiated males from the D. virilis laboratory stock

      radiosensitivity was outlined. The mechanism of this phenomenon and the
      possibilities of using the property of genome instability for the productive
      induction of gene and chromosome damage in radiation mutagenesis experiments are 
      discussed.

PG  - 233-8
AB  - The complete glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene of Drosophila virilis
      isolated by screening with alpha GPDHM cDNA of the adult fly was sequenced. The
      gene contains eight exons spread over a total of approximate 8 kb DNA. Its
      exon/intron organization is identical to that of D. melanogaster. A single
      transcription initiation site was determined by primer extension. The stop codons
      are located at the 3' end of each of the exons 6 to 8. TATA and CAAT boxes are
      present upstream of the transcriptional start site. Adult alpha GPDH protein is
      encoded by exons 1 to 6 and exon 8. Comparison of the sequence with that of D.
      melanogaster showed that the homology of the nucleotide sequence of the coding
      region is 85% and that the homology of the amino acid sequence is 98%. On the
      contrary, the non-coding region is quite different in length and nucleotide
      sequence.

TI  - Ulysses transposable element of Drosophila shows high structural similarities to 
      functional domains of retroviruses.
PG  - 917-24
AB  - We have determined the DNA structure of the Ulysses transposable element of
      Drosophila virilis and found that this transposon is 10,653 bp and is flanked by 
      two unusually large direct repeats 2136 bp long. Ulysses shows the characteristic
      organization of LTR-containing retrotransposons, with matrix and capsid protein
      domains encoded in the first open reading frame. In addition, Ulysses contains
      protease, reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase domains encoded in the
      second open reading frame. Ulysses lacks a third open reading frame present in
      some retrotransposons that could encode an env-like protein. A dendrogram
      analysis based on multiple alignments of the protease, reverse transcriptase,
      RNase H, integrase and tRNA primer binding site of all known Drosophila
      LTR-containing retrotransposon sequences establishes a phylogenetic relationship 
      of Ulysses to other retrotransposons and suggests that Ulysses belongs to a new
      family of this type of elements.

TI  - Point mutations in the Drosophila hairy gene demonstrate in vivo requirements for
      basic, helix-loop-helix, and WRPW domains.
PG  - 2475-83
AB  - The Drosophila pair-rule gene, hairy (h), encodes a nuclear basic
      helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein that regulates embryonic segmentation and adult
      bristle patterning. In both cases, the h protein behaves as a transcriptional
      repressor. In this study, we determined the molecular nature of 12 h alleles. One
      mutation maps within the HLH domain, consistent with h function requiring
      homodimerization or heterodimerization with other HLH proteins. A second mutation
      lies in the basic domain, suggesting that DNA binding is required for h activity.
      Several mutations show that the h C terminus, in particular the WRPW domain, is
      also required for h activity, perhaps by interacting with other proteins to
      mediate transcriptional repression. We show that the h protein in Drosophila
      virilis closely resembles that in D. melanogaster and includes completely
      conserved bHLH and WRPW domains.

TI  - Interspecific comparison of the transformer gene of Drosophila reveals an
      unusually high degree of evolutionary divergence.
PG  - 113-28
AB  - The transformer (tra) gene of Drosophila melanogaster occupies an intermediate
      position in the regulatory pathway controlling all aspects of somatic sexual
      differentiation. The female-specific expression of this gene's function is
      regulated by the Sex lethal (Sxl) gene, through a mechanism involving
      sex-specific alternative splicing of tra pre-mRNA. The tra gene encodes a protein
      that is thought to act in conjunction with the transformer-2 (tra-2) gene product
      to control the sex-specific processing of doublesex (dsx) pre-mRNA. The
      bifunctional dsx gene carries out opposite functions in the two sexes, repressing
      female differentiation in males and repressing male differentiation in females.
      Here we report the results from an evolutionary approach to investigate tra
      regulation and function, by isolating the tra-homologous genes from selected
      Drosophila species, and then using the interspecific DNA sequence comparisons to 
      help identify regions of functional significance. The tra-homologous genes from
      two Sophophoran subgenus species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila erecta, and 
      two Drosophila subgenus species, Drosophila hydei and Drosophila virilis, were
      cloned, sequenced and compared to the D. melanogaster tra gene. This comparison
      reveals an unusually high degree of evolutionary divergence among the tra coding 
      sequences. These studies also highlight a highly conserved sequence within intron
      one that probably defines a cis-acting regulator of the sex-specific alternative 
      splicing event.

TI  - Conserved DNA binding and self-association domains of the Drosophila zeste
      protein.
PG  - 598-608
AB  - The zeste gene product is involved in two types of genetic effects dependent on
      chromosome pairing: transvection and the zeste-white interaction. Comparison of
      the predicted amino acid sequence with that of the Drosophila virilis gene shows 
      that several blocks of amino acid sequence have been very highly conserved. One
      of these regions corresponds to the DNA binding domain. Site-directed mutations
      in this region indicate that a sequence resembling that of the homeodomain DNA
      recognition helix is essential for DNA binding activity. The integrity of an
      amphipathic helical region is also essential for binding activity and is likely
      to be responsible for dimerization of the DNA binding domain. Another very
      strongly conserved domain of zeste is the C-terminal region, predicted to form a 
      long helical structure with two sets of heptad repeats that constitute two long
      hydrophobic ridges at opposite ends and on opposite faces of the helix. We show
      that this domain is responsible for the extensive aggregation properties of zeste
      that are required for its role in transvection phenomena. A model is proposed
      according to which the hydrophobic ridges induce the formation of open-ended
      coiled-coil structures holding together many hundreds of zeste molecules and
      possibly anchoring these complexes to other nuclear structures.

      techniques of polyacrylamide electrophoresis and agarose electrophoresis reveals 
      that the former three loci are highly polymorphic in all these populations.
      According to the allelic frequency of the 5 loci, a genetic distance between the 
      above-mentioned populations was calculated. Along with the results obtained by Mr
      He Chaozheng from Hongze, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Ningbo populations, a dendrogram 
      was made. It was found that Quanzhou and Fuzhou populations differed from the
      others in allelic frequencies and genetic distances which suggests that this
      difference is related to the extent of geographic isolation among them.

TI  - Genetic basis of reduced eyes in the hybrids of Drosophila virilis phylad
      species.
PG  - 275-85
AB  - Structural anomalies were detected in F1 and backcross hybrids of Drosophila
      virilis and three of its sibling species Drosophila novamexicana, Drosophila
      americana texana and Drosophila americana americana. Similar but not identical
      anomalies have been described in D. virilis x D. lummei hybrids. F1 (D. virilis x
      D. novamexicana) hybrids had only slight disorders in the abdominal cuticula, but
      5.3% of the first backcross generation hybrids had reduced eyes. Eye defects in
      the second generation were due to interaction of the heterozygous fourth
      chromosome of D. novamexicana with the homozygous D. virilis chromosomes 2 and 3.
      Reciprocal F1 hybrids between D. virilis and D. a. americana and between D.
      virilis and D. a. texana had normal eyes, but in the second hybrid generation
      4.9% of D. virilis x D. a. americana and 1.6% of D. virilis x D. a. texana
      hybrids had anomalous eyes. In D. virilis x D. a. texana hybrids, the
      heterozygous fourth chromosome of D. a. texana was incompatible with homozygous
      D. virilis chromosomes 2 and 3. Of the D. virilis x D. a. americana hybrids
      homozygous for D. virilis chromosomes 2 and 3, 10.2% had the eye defect. The
      incompatibility system of non-conspecific chromosomes causing the eye anomalies
      in the hybrids of these three species pairs was different from those in D.
      virilis x D. lummei hybrids and has evolved independently after the diverging of 
      the American lineage from D. lummei.

TI  - Species-specific differences in tissue-specific expression of alcohol
      dehydrogenase are under the control of complex cis-acting loci: evidence from
      Drosophila hybrids.
PG  - 577-92
AB  - Differences in the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase in the hindgut and testis 
      of adult Drosophila virilis, D. texana, D. novamexicana and D. borealis flies
      were observed. These heritable differences do not arise due to chromosomal
      rearrangements, since the polytene chromosome banding patterns did not reveal any
      such gross chromosomal rearrangements near the Adh locus in any of the tested
      species. Analysis of the interspecific hybrids revealed that these differences
      are controlled by complex cis-acting genetic loci. Further, the cis-acting locus 
      controlling the expression of ADH in testis was found to be separable by
      crossing-over.

TI  - Evolution of gene position: chromosomal arrangement and sequence comparison of
      the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis sina and Rh4 genes.
PG  - 10203-7
AB  - The seven in absentia (sina) gene of Drosophila encodes a nuclear protein
      required for normal eye development. In Drosophila melanogaster, the sina gene is
      located within an intron of the Rh4 opsin gene. We examine here the nucleotide
      sequences and chromosomal arrangements of these genes in Drosophila virilis. An
      interspecies comparison between D. melanogaster and D. virilis reveals that the
      protein-coding sequences of the sina and Rh4 genes are highly conserved, but the 
      relative chromosomal position and structural arrangement of these genes differ
      between the two species. In particular, the sina and Rh4 genes are widely
      separated in D. virilis, and there is no intron in the Rh4 gene. Our results
      suggest that the Rh4 gene was translocated to another chromosomal location by a
      retrotransposition event.

PG  - 379-94
AB  - Systematic relationship among the 12 species of the Drosophila virilis species
      group, and Drosophila robusta, were investigated by the use of two-dimensional
      electrophoresis (2-DE). A total of 389 protein characters (about 200 loci) were
      scored and analyzed both phylogenetically and phenetically. The resulting
      phylogeny was found to be largely concordant with the current views of evolution 
      among these species based on other independent morphological, chromosomal,
      electrophoretic, and immunological data sets, although some notable differences
      were observed. The 2-DE data also appeared to be useful for constructing a
      molecular clock to date the absolute times of divergence among the species. It
      appears from this analysis that the evolution of the major clades within the
      species group occurred about 20 million years ago. Previous suggestions that the 
      rate of molecular evolution was different between the virilis and montana phylads
      was not confirmed. The technique of 2-DE seems to be an excellent tool for
      reconstructing phylogenies and should be particularly valuable for examining
      relatively closely related species.

TI  - Sterility of male and female hybrids of Drosophila virilis and Drosophila lummei.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - The sterility of interspecific hybrids between the sibling species Drosophila
      virilis and D. lummei was tested in reciprocal F1s and different second
      generation combinations of cytoplasm, sex chromosomes and autosomes. Males with
      motile sperm and females with at least one mature egg were scored as fertile.
      When D. virilis was the mother, about 5 per cent of the F1 male progeny was
      sterile, the reason being that the X of D. virilis was weakly incompatible with
      the heterozygous second, fourth and fifth chromosomes. The F1 males carrying the 
      X chromosome of D. lummei were all fertile. The X chromosome of D. lummei, and in
      particular its species-specific double inversion In(1)a + b, nevertheless caused 
      sterility in 70 per cent of males in the presence of homozygous autosomes of D.
      virilis. Sterility was rare among the females, although some weakly
      disadvantageous X versus autosome and autosome versus autosome interactions were 
      detected. The male and female hybrid sterilities were based on different genetic 
      systems. The results emphasize the central role of the X chromosome in hybrid
      male sterility.

TI  - Species differences in the temporal pattern of Drosophila urate oxidase gene
      expression are attributed to trans-acting regulatory changes.
PG  - 5489-93
AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster urate oxidase (UO)-encoding gene is expressed in the 
      third-instar larva and adult. In contrast, the Drosophila pseudoobscura UO gene
      is only expressed in the adult, whereas the Drosophila virilis UO gene is
      expressed only in the third-instar larva. UO activity in these three Drosophila
      species is detected exclusively within the Malpighian tubules. By using P-element
      mediated germ-line transformation, UO genes from D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis 
      were integrated into the D. melanogaster genome. The D. virilis and D.
      pseudoobscura UO transgenes were expressed in the third-instar larva and adult
      Malpighian tubules, which is the D. melanogaster temporal pattern of UO gene
      expression. These observations indicate that differences in the temporal patterns
      of regulation of UO genes among these three Drosophila species are not likely to 
      be due to evolutionary changes in the sequence or complement of UO cis-acting
      regulatory elements. The species differences in UO regulation are probably the
      result of changes in one or more trans-acting factors required for UO gene
      expression in the third-instar larval and adult stages.

TI  - The genetic basis of a species-specific character in the Drosophila virilis
      species group.
PG  - 331-7
AB  - The genetic basis of the species-specific dorsal abdominal stripe of Drosophila
      novamexicana was examined. The dorsal stripe is present in D. novamexicana and
      absent in all other members of the Drosophila virilis species group.
      Interspecific crosses between D. novamexicana and genetically marked D. virilis
      revealed that all four of the autosomes (except the tiny dot chromosome, which
      was not marked) and the sex chromosomes (the X and Y chromosome effects could not
      be disentangled) showed a significant effect on the width of the dorsal stripe.
      All the autosomes act approximately additively; only minor interactions were
      detected among them. No significant maternal effects were found. This means that 
      a minimum of five loci are involved in the character difference between the two
      species, and this is the maximum number that this technique could discern. These 
      results suggest that, based on the number of factors involved in the character
      difference, the inheritance of this character should be considered polygenic, but
      because chromosome 2 (the largest chromosome in the species) contributed over
      half of the variance toward the character difference, it is best to consider the 
      inheritance oligogenic based on effect. The implications of these findings are
      discussed in light of the importance of macromutation in speciation and the sex
      chromosome theory of speciation.

TI  - Organizational analysis of elav gene and functional analysis of ELAV protein of
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 2994-3000
AB  - Drosophila virilis genomic DNA corresponding to the D. melanogaster embryonic
      lethal abnormal visual system (elav) locus was cloned. DNA sequence analysis of a
      3.8-kb genomic piece allowed identification of (i) an open reading frame (ORF)
      with striking homology to the previously identified D. melanogaster ORF and (ii) 
      conserved sequence elements of possible regulatory relevance within and flanking 
      the second intron. Conceptual translation of the D. virilis ORF predicts a
      519-amino-acid-long ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence-type protein. Similar to
      D. melanogaster ELAV protein, it contains three tandem RNA-binding domains and an
      alanine/glutamine-rich amino-terminal region. The sequence throughout the
      RNA-binding domains, comprising the carboxy-terminal 346 amino acids, shows an
      extraordinary 100% identity at the amino acid level, indicating a strong
      structural constraint for this functional domain. The amino-terminal region is 36
      amino acids longer in D. virilis, and the conservation is 66%. In in vivo
      functional tests, the D. virilis ORF was indistinguishable from the D.
      melanogaster ORF. Furthermore, a D. melanogaster ORF encoding an ELAV protein
      with a 40-amino-acid deletion within the alanine/glutamine-rich region was also
      able to supply elav function in vivo. Thus, the divergence of the amino-terminal 
      region of the ELAV protein reflects lowered functional constraint rather than

TI  - Wrinkling of the eye in hybrids between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila lummei 
      is caused by interaction of maternal and zygotic genes.
PG  - 357-65
AB  - Hybrids of Drosophila virilis females and Drosophila lummei males have visible
      developmental anomalies in external adult structures. Reciprocal hybrids are
      normal, and the anomalies are not found in other interspecific F1 hybrids of the 
      virilis subgroup. Antibiotic treatments with ampicillin, streptomycin and
      tetracycline did not cure the syndrome. The genetic basis of the wrinkling of the
      compound eye was analysed in detail. Both male and female F1 progeny of D.
      virilis mothers were affected, indicating that wrinkling of eyes is maternally
      determined. F1 hybrid females produced healthy progeny. Backcross hybrid females 
      (D. virilis x F1) with 16 different combinations of autosomes, either
      heterozygous or homozygous for D. virilis, were crossed with D. lummei males. It 
      was found that homozygous D. virilis chromosomes 2 and 5 together were necessary 
      to induce the maternal effect. The hybrid zygote responded to the maternal effect
      when the chromosomes 2, 4 and/or 5 were heterozygous. Elimination of the small
      sixth (dot) chromosome of D. lummei from the hybrids was correlated with the
      wrinkling of eyes, but was not the cause, as the two phenomena had a different
      genetic basis and temperature response. Furthermore, the eyes were wrinkled in
      flies which presumably had had no D. lummei dot chromosome to lose.

TI  - Interspecific comparison of the unusually repetitive Drosophila locus mastermind.
PG  - 415-20
AB  - The mastermind gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a novel, highly repetitive
      nuclear protein required for neural development. To identify functionally
      important regions we have initiated an interspecific comparison of the gene in
      Drosophila virilis. Mastermind transcription and genomic organization are similar
      in both species and sequence analysis reveals significant conservation in a major
      cluster of charged amino acids. In contrast, extensive variation is noted in
      homopolymer domains that immediately flank the acidic cluster. Distinct patterns 
      of evolutionary change can be identified: the major difference between unique
      regions are occasional amino acid substitutions whereas the repetitive areas are 
      characterized by numerous large in-frame insertions/deletions and a nearly
      threefold higher rate of amino acid replacement. Conservation of the acidic
      domain suggests that it has an important functional role whereas the
      hypervariable homopolymer regions appear to be under less selective constraints
      than adjacent unique areas.

TI  - Analysis of the promoter region of the housekeeping gene DmRP140 by sequence
      comparison of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - To analyze the transcriptional control regions of Drosophila melanogaster
      household genes, we have characterized the promoter of the gene coding for the
      second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (DmRP140). Analysis of cDNA revealed 
      that the coding region of the protein extends beyond the originally assumed
      transcription start point (tsp) and deduced translation start codon [Falkenburg
      et al., J. Mol. Biol. 195 (1987) 929-937] and that the tsp determined previously 
      corresponds to an intron/exon boundary of an additional intron. Upstream of the
      polII gene we found a transcription unit that is transcribed in the opposite
      direction. The initiating ATGs of the two genes are only 467 nucleotides (nt)
      apart. The untranslated region is extremely A + T-rich (88%) but none of the
      transcription units is preceded by a canonical TATA element. It does not feature 
      any other known nt sequence motifs thought to be necessary for the basic
      transcriptional machinery; yet, this region functions as a bidirectional
      promoter: a central 309-bp fragment directs transcription of a reporter gene in
      transiently transfected Drosophila culture cells in both orientations. The gene
      coding for the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II of Drosophila virilis 
      (DvRP140) was isolated and partially analyzed. The gene is located on the second 
      chromosome at 22F/23A which corresponds to the position determined for D.

      higher (more than twice) in the stock 147 than that in the stock 101. Significant
      increase of dopamine quantity in both stocks was observed under heat stress
      (serotonin remaining unchanged), while the level of response in the stock 101 was
      twice as high as in adults of the stock 147. The response typical of the stock
      147 was prevailing in the hybrids F1 (147 x 101).

TI  - Interspecific comparisons of the structure and regulation of the Drosophila
      ecdysone-inducible gene E74.
PG  - 535-43
AB  - The Drosophila melanogaster E74 gene is induced directly by the steroid hormone
      ecdysone and is a member of a small set of "early" genes that appear to trigger
      the onset of metamorphosis. The gene consists of three overlapping transcription 
      units encoding two proteins, E74A and E74B, which possess a common C terminus.
      According to the Ashburner model for ecdysone's action, an E74 protein product
      potentially functions as a transcriptional activator of "late" genes as well as a
      repressor of early genes. We have taken an evolutionary approach to understand
      the function and regulation of E74 by isolating the homologous genes from
      Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila virilis and comparing them to D.
      melanogaster E74 sequences. Conserved characteristics of the E74 genes include
      ecdysone inducibility, localization to ecdysone-induced polytene chromosome
      puffs, and gene size. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the E74A protein reveal 
      a highly conserved C-terminal region that is rich in basic amino acid residues
      and which has been proposed to possess sequence-specific DNA binding activity.
      The moderately conserved N-terminal region has maintained its overall acidic
      character and is a potential transcriptional activator domain. The central region
      contains conserved glutamine and alanine homopolymeric repeats of variable
      lengths. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of the E74A promoter region fail to
      reveal ecdysone-response elements but do identify conserved sequences that may
      function in E74A regulation.

TI  - Unusual Drosophila virilis stress-puff at 20CD: cytological localization of a
      heat sensitive locus and some peculiarities of the heat shock response.
PG  - 283-90
AB  - Using a series of chromosome aberrations a heat shock (hs) inducible site of the 
      Drosophila virilis heat shock puff 20CD has been cytologically localized in the
      distal 20C subdivision: the hs puff was not observable in chromosome 2 carrying
      the Df(2)ebTG-52 deficiency; the bands in the proximal 20D subdivision could not 
      autonomously be activated by hs in aberrant chromosomes that have this deficiency
      or the In(2)ebPC-19 inversion. An electron microscopy (EM) analysis of the
      successive stages of puff development in the 20CD and 20F regions shows that the 
      20CD puff is intially formed from the right part of the 20C6-7 band. In the
      maximally developed puff, the neighboring bands of the 20C and 20D regions are
      only partially decondensed; they are seen as discrete compact chromatin clumps.
      Specific differences in the ultrastructural organization and in response to hs
      have been found between the D. virilis "unusual" 20CD and typical 20F hs puffs.

TI  - Viability of first and second generation hybrids of Drosophila virilis and
      Drosophila lummei.
PG  - 435-47
AB  - F1 hybrids of D. virilis and D. lummei survived significantly worse than the
      parents. When D. virilis was the mother, larger proportion of hybrids failed to
      emerge from pupal case, but overall survival rate of reciprocals was about the
      same. Viability of different heterospecific combinations of sex chromosomes and
      autosomes was studied in backcrosses. All the sex chromosomes survived well on
      the background of all-heterozygous autosomes. Hemizygous X was reciprocally
      subvital with homozygous alien autosomes. The reduced viability was male sex
      limited. The X-linked factor causing this effect was localized in the area of the
      large, phylogenetically ancient double inversion In(1)a+b. All four large
      autosomes were heterotic in backcross hybrids, more strongly in females. Five out
      of six possible first degree interactions between the autosomes were negative,
      indicating incompatibility between heterospecific autosomes. This effect was
      stronger in females. The genetic basis for hybrid subvitality is sex-specific.

TI  - A long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon is mobilized during hybrid
      dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 9615-9
AB  - A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome similar to those described in Drosophila
      melanogaster occurs in Drosophila virilis when a laboratory stock is crossed to a
      wild strain collected in the Batumi region of Georgia (U.S.S.R). Mutations in
      various loci obtained during these crosses are presumably induced by the
      insertion of DNA sequences. We have cloned an induced white mutation and
      characterized the insertion sequence responsible for the mutant phenotype. This
      sequence is a 10.6-kilobase (kb) transposable element we have named Ulysses. This
      element is flanked by unusually large 2.1-kb long terminal repeats. Ulysses also 
      contains other landmarks characteristic of the retrotransposon family, such as a 
      tRNA-binding site adjacent to the 5' long terminal repeat and open reading frames
      encoding putative products with homology to the reverse transcriptase, protease, 
      and integrase domains typical of proteins encoded by vertebrate retroviruses.
      Some of the mutations obtained do not contain a copy of the Ulysses element at
      the mutant locus, suggesting that a different transposable element may be
      responsible for the mutation. Therefore, Ulysses may not be the primary cause of 
      the entire dysgenic syndrome, and its mobilization may be the result of
      activation by an independent mobile element.

TI  - A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 619-23
AB  - A new example of "hybrid dysgenesis" has been demonstrated in the F1 progeny of
      crosses between two different strains of Drosophila virilis. The dysgenic traits 
      were observed only in hybrids obtained when wild-type females (of the Batumi
      strain 9 from Georgia, USSR) were crossed to males from a marker strain (the
      long-established laboratory strain, strain 160, carrying recessive markers on all
      its autosomes). The phenomena observed include high frequencies of male and
      female sterility, male recombination, chromosomal nondisjunction, transmission
      ratio distortion and the appearance of numerous visible mutations at different
      loci in the progeny of dysgenic crosses. The sterility demonstrated in the
      present study is similar to that of P-M dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and
      apparently results from underdevelopment of the gonads in both sexes, this
      phenomenon being sensitive to developmental temperature. However, in contrast to 
      the P-M and I-R dysgenic systems in D. melanogaster, in D. virilis the highest
      level of sterility (95-98%) occurs at 23-25 degrees. Several of the mutations
      isolated from the progeny of dysgenic crosses (e.g., singed) proved to be
      unstable and reverted to wild type. We hypothesize that a mobile element
      ("Ulysses") which we have recently isolated from a dysgenically induced white eye
      mutation may be responsible for the phenomena observed.

TI  - Genetic analysis of variation in the number of primary spermatocytes per cyst in 
      Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 335-41
AB  - Two experiments were performed with the aim of clarifying the genetic basis of
      variation in the number of primary spermatocytes per cyst in the B12 strain of
      Drosophila virilis and identifying the chromosome responsible for the variation. 
      First, crosses between B12, showing a mean cell number of 11.81, and strain TK
      with a mean of 7.91, were performed. From the results obtained, it was considered
      that there were two factors, i.e., a recessive gene and certain modifiers, which 
      shifted the cell number toward a higher value in B12. Second, chromosomal
      analysis with a marker strain and the B12 strain revealed that the third
      chromosome of B12 was responsible for the major effect of changing the primary
      spermatocyte number, although this chromosome did not exert a sufficient effect
      alone, and furthermore that at least one of the modifiers located on the second
      chromosome.

TI  - [Effect of individual chromosomes on sex behavior of Drosophila].
PG  - 1591-6
AB  - Dependence of intensity of Drosophila virilis male sexual behaviour on
      age-related differences was studied. Most active proved to be those age periods
      which correlated with the time of S-esterase elevated activity. Courtship
      displays were compared in strains 101 and 160, interstrain differences
      correlating with the S-esterase activity level. As S-esterase plays an important 
      role in fertilization, this relationship seems to be non-random. It is quite
      possible that the level of S-esterase activity regulates male sexual activity in 
      natural populations. Some variations in male courtship display in interspecies
      hybrids (D. virilis x D. littoralis) were demonstrated which depended on the gene
      dose of respective species. It may well be that in the bk and dt gene regions
      those genes are localized which are responsible for courtship behaviour. The
      analysis of sexual behaviour in interstrain and interspecies hybrids proved to be
      successful approach to elucidating possible role of separate chromosomes in
      sexual behaviour determination.

TI  - Structural and functional comparisons of the Drosophila virilis and Drosophila

PG  - 5916-20
AB  - We have isolated the homeobox gene rough (ro) from Drosophila virilis. Comparison
      of the predicted amino acid sequences of the D. melanogaster and D. virilis rough
      proteins reveals that domains of high conservation, including the homeodomain,
      are interspersed with highly diverged regions. Stretches of significant sequence 
      conservation are also observed in the 5' promoter region and in the introns. The 
      D. virilis rough gene rescues the rough mutant phenotype and is properly
      regulated when introduced into the D. melanogaster genome. Thus the rough protein
      as well as the cis-regulatory elements that ensure proper temporal and spatial
      regulation are functionally conserved between these Drosophila species.

TI  - Discrepancy in divergence of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of Drosophila 
      teissieri and Drosophila yakuba.
PG  - 500-8
AB  - Restriction sites were compared in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules from
      representatives of two closely related species of fruit flies: nine strains of
      Drosophila teissieri and eight strains of Drosophila yakuba. Nucleotide
      diversities among D. teissieri strains and among D. yakuba strains were 0.07% and
      0.03%, respectively, and the nucleotide distance between the species was 0.22%.
      Also determined was the nucleotide sequence of a 2305-nucleotide pair (ntp)
      segment of the mtDNA molecule of D. teissieri that contains the noncoding adenine
      + thymine (A + T)-rich region (1091 ntp) as well as the genes for the
      mitochondrial small-subunit rRNA, tRNA(f-met), tRNA(gln), and tRNA(ile), and
      portions of the ND2 and tRNA(Val) genes. This sequence differs from the
      corresponding segment of the D. yakuba mtDNA by base substitutions at 0.1% and
      0.8% of the positions in the coding and noncoding regions, respectively. The
      higher divergence due to base substitutions in the A + T-rich region is
      accompanied by a greater number of insertions/deletions than in the coding
      regions. From alignment of the D. teissieri A + T-rich sequence with those of D. 
      yakuba and Drosophila virilis, it appears that the 40% of this sequence that lies
      adjacent to the tRNA(ile) gene has been highly conserved. Divergence between the 
      entire D. teissieri and D. yakuba mtDNA molecules, estimated from the sequences, 
      was 0.3%; this value is close to the value (0.22%) obtained from the restriction 
      analysis, but 10 times lower than the value estimated from published DNA
      hybridization results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Interspecific comparison of a Drosophila gene encoding FMRFamide-related
      neuropeptides.
PG  - 1929-42
AB  - In order to identify functionally important regions of a neuropeptide gene in
      Drosophila melanogaster, we have studied its occurrence in related species and
      have characterized the structure of a homologous gene in Drosophila virilis. The 
      melanogaster gene encodes a precursor that contains 13 neuropeptides related to
      the molluscan tetrapeptide FMRFamide (Nambu et al., 1988; Schneider and Taghert, 
      1988). Using the melanogaster gene as a probe in Southern blot analysis, related 
      sequences were detected in DNA from each of 7 species tested. D. virilis, which
      is estimated to have diverged from D. melanogaster between 60 and 80 million
      years ago (Throckmorton, 1975), was chosen for more detailed study.
      Immunocytochemical staining using an antibody to authentic FMRFamide revealed a
      similar set of immunoreactive neurons in the CNS of larvae from the 2 Drosophila 
      species. Using a melanogaster gene probe, overlapping clones were isolated from a
      virilis genomic library; DNA sequence analysis indicated the presence of a
      homologous gene. Comparisons of the genes and deduced proteins between the 2
      species revealed the following points. (1) Both genes are divided into 2 exons:
      in D. melanogaster the exons are 106 and 1352 bp long; in D. virilis, they are
      169 and at least 1232 bp long; in both species, the intron is approximately 2.5
      kb long. (2) The sequence of exon I has largely diverged, and in neither species 
      are exon I sequences translated. In this vicinity of the gene, sequence
      conservation is limited to a 67 bp region that spans the TATA box and the RNA
      start site. (3) The deduced neuropeptide precursors have very similar sizes (347 
      vs 339 amino acids) and the presumed signal sequences are perfectly conserved.
      (4) While the melanogaster precursor contains 13 FMRFamide-related peptides, the 
      virilis precursor contains only 10. (5) The sequences of some but not all of the 
      FMRFamide-like peptides are perfectly conserved. (6) In the rest of the
      precursor, significant sequence conservation is found only in the N-terminal
      portion; immediately downstream of the final FMRFamide-like peptide, the protein 
      sequences are highly divergent. (7) 5' to the RNA start sites (1.2 kb of
      melanogaster DNA and 1.8 kb of virilis DNA), 17 small (9-52 base pairs) regions
      are evolutionarily conserved (greater than 80% sequence conservation). We discuss
      neuropeptide biosynthesis, the functions and evolution of FMRFamide-like
      neuropeptides in insects, and the cell-specific regulation of neuropeptide gene
      expression in the contexts of these results.

TI  - Simple human DNA-repeats associated with genomic hypervariability, flanking the
      genomic retroposons and similar to retroviral sites.
PG  - 1879-85
AB  - Earlier we found a human hypervariable genomic region (GVR). The DNA
      hybridization probe isolated from this region detects multiple hypervariability
      of restriction DNA fragments from genomic loci. The sequencing data suggest that 
      the genomic instability and variability are associated with tandem DNA repeats.
      The DNA hybridization probe contains two families of simple DNA repeats
      designated as 'apo' and 'tau'. The (TC)n-rich family of DNA 'tau'-repeats bears
      some similarity to the simple transcribed repeats of Drosophila virilis, simple
      repetitive motifs of the human proenkephaline gene exon 1, and short sites of
      retroviral LTR ends. Apo-repeats show an unusual similarity to Rauscher viral env
      gene site. Besides GVR, apo- and tau-like repeats are localized in other genomic 
      loci and can form separate tandem clusters and terminal repeats flanking certain 
      copies of retroposons (Alu-SINES).

TI  - Developmental anomalies in Drosophila hybrids are apparently caused by loss of
      microchromosome.
PG  - 255-62
AB  - Hybrids produced by crossing Drosophila virilis females to D. lummei males suffer
      from many developmental anomalies; the reciprocal hybridization yields normal
      offspring. Genetic analysis reveals that these anomalies involve a maternal
      effect: whether or not an individual will show an anomaly depends upon his
      mother's nuclear genotype. Several lines of evidence suggest that the proximal
      cause of the anomalies is the elimination of the D. lummei microchromosome
      (chromosome 6) from hybrids. Loss of the D. lummei microchromosome in this
      hybridization is known to involve a maternal effect (Evgen'ev, 1973), as mitosis 
      in early development is under the control of maternally-acting genes.

TI  - Glue protein genes in Drosophila virilis: their organization, developmental
      control of transcription and specific mRNA degradation.
PG  - 269-80
AB  - The gene Lgp-1, which is localized in the intermoult puff 16A of D. virilis
      polytene chromosomes, encodes the major larval glue protein Igp-1. The gene
      consists of two exons interrupted by a short intron. In the 5' flanking region of
      Lgp-1, we find putative ecdysone receptor binding sites and two proximal
      conserved sequence motifs which are possibly involved in gene regulation. The
      amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence reveals a relationship to the
      68C glue protein family of D. melanogaster. The size of the Lgp-1 transcripts
      decreases in late third instar larvae concomitantly with their disappearance.
      This is caused by deadenylation followed by distinct nucleolytic attacks in the
      3' untranslated region. Preliminary data suggest the presence of another glue
      protein gene in the 16A puff region which is related to the Lgp-1 gene.

AB  - Genes from two Drosophila virilis intermoult puffs were isolated by microcloning.
      From puff 16A on the X-chromosome a 2.9 kb DNA fragment was obtained, which
      hybridizes with three transcripts. Two of them represent the mRNAs for larval
      glue proteins. They are found in different abundancies in third larval instar
      salivary glands, but also in minor amounts in midgut and in fat body. In puff 55E
      on chromosome III two genes were identified. They are transcribed exclusively in 
      salivary glands during all three larval instars. Therefore, their products must
      be related to another gland-specific function, which is sustained throughout
      larval life.

PG  - 182-8
AB  - The sites of seven tRNA genes (Arg-2, Lys-2, Ser-2b, Ser-7, Thr-3, Thr-4, Val-3b)
      were studied by in situ hybridization. 125I-labeled tRNA probes from Drosophila
      melanogaster were hybridized to spreads of polytene chromosomes prepared from
      four Drosophila species representing different evolutionary lineages (D.
      melanogaster, Drosophila hydei, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila
      virilis). Most tRNA loci occurred on homologous chromosomal elements of all four 
      species. In some cases the number of hybridization sites within an element varied
      and sites on nonhomologous elements were found. It was observed that both
      tRNA(2Arg) and tRNA(2Lys) hybridized to the same site on homologous elements in
      several species. These data suggest a limited amount of exchange among different 
      linkage groups during the evolution of Drosophila species.

      in Drosophila virilis: genetic and biochemical aspects].
PG  - 1979-87
AB  - The development of resistance to the insecticide effect of juvenile hormone
      analogue (AJH-I) in Drosophila was studied. It is found that under the AJH-I
      treatment metamorphosis in D. virilis was delayed and some insects died.
      Selection of resistant flies was performed using sublethal dose of AJH-I
      (viability was 8%). The selection at such dose of AJH-I resulted in an increase
      in the proportion of resistant flies up to 30% already by the F3, whereafter is
      fluctuated within the range of 24-46% for further 12 generations. The increase in
      resistance to the lethal effect of AJH-I was also accompanied by an increase in
      resistance to its teratogenic effects. An analysis of the kinetics of selection
      has shown that the AJH-I resistance is controlled by more than one gene. It is
      established that the increase in resistance is associated with selection of
      individuals having high activity of juvenile hormone esterase.

TI  - Comparison of the gap segmentation gene hunchback between Drosophila melanogaster
      and Drosophila virilis reveals novel modes of evolutionary change.
PG  - 1517-25
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced a large portion of the hunchback (hb) locus from
      Drosophila virilis. Comparison with the Drosophila melanogaster hb sequence shows
      multiple strong homologies in the upstream and downstream regions of the gene,
      including most of the known functional parts. The coding sequence is highly
      conserved within the presumptive DNA-binding finger regions, but more diverged
      outside of them. The regions of high divergence are correlated with regions which
      are rich in short direct repeats (regions of high 'cryptic simplicity'),
      suggesting a significant influence of slippage-like mechanisms in the
      evolutionary divergence of the two genes. Staining of early D.virilis embryos
      with an hb antibody reveals conserved and divergent features of the spatial
      expression pattern at blastoderm stage. It appears that the basic expression
      pattern, which serves as the gap gene function of hb, is conserved, while certain
      secondary expression patterns, which have separate functions for the segmentation
      process, are partly diverged. Thus, both slippage driven mutations in the coding 
      region, which are likely to occur at higher rates than point mutations and the
      evolutionary divergence of secondary expression patterns may contribute to the
      evolution of regulatory genes.

TI  - A neuron-specific enhancer of the Drosophila dopa decarboxylase gene.
PG  - 676-86
AB  - At least two cis-regulatory elements are necessary for correct neuron-specific
      expression of the Drosophila melanogaster dopa decarboxylase gene, Ddc. In
      addition to a previously described proximal element located approximately 60 bp
      upstream of the mRNA start site, we have now characterized a distal approximately
      600-bp DNA fragment, extending from -1019 to -1623 bp, which possesses
      enhancer-like properties and is essential for normal neuron-specific expression. 
      Immunofluorescent labeling of neurons expressing deleted Ddc genes indicates that
      this region contains both general neuronal regulatory elements and cell-specific 
      elements that selectively affect Ddc expression in either dopaminergic or
      serotonergic neurons. These selective effects can be correlated with the removal 
      of sequence elements that are protected from DNase digestion by factors present
      in embryonic nuclear extracts. Several of these elements are also homologous to
      sequences located upstream of the evolutionarily diverged Ddc gene of Drosophila 
      virilis. These results suggest that the neuron-specific expression of Ddc results
      from the combined action of several factors binding within this distal enhancer
      region.

AB  - Twenty-four biotin-labeled recombinant-DNA probes which contained putative
      unique-sequence Drosophila melanogaster DNA were hybridized to larval
      salivary-gland chromosomes of D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. All probes 
      hybridized to D. melanogaster chromosomes at the expected sites. However, one
      probe hybridized to at least 16 additional sites, and one hybridized to one
      additional site. Thirteen probes hybridized strongly to D. virilis chromosomes,
      four hybridized weakly and infrequently, and seven did not hybridize. Probes
      representing two multigene families (beta-tubulin and yolk-protein) hybridized as
      would be expected if all sites had been conserved in the two species on the same 
      chromosomal elements. The multiple hybridization sites of a third probe which may
      represent a multigene family were also conserved. The results were consistent
      with H.J. Muller's proposal that chromosomal elements have been conserved during 
      evolution of this genus.

TI  - The genetics of postzygotic isolation in the Drosophila virilis group.
PG  - 527-37
AB  - In a genetic study of postzygotic reproductive isolation among species of the
      Drosophila virilis group, we find that the X chromosome has the largest effect on
      male and female hybrid sterility and inviability. The X alone has a discernible
      effect on postzygotic isolation between closely related species. Hybridizations
      involving more distantly related species also show large X-effects, although the 
      autosomes may also play a role. In the only hybridization yet subjected to such
      analysis, we show that hybrid male and female sterility result from the action of
      different X-linked loci. Our results accord with genetic studies of other taxa,
      and support the view that both Haldane's rule (heterogametic F1 sterility or
      inviability) and the large effect of the X chromosome on reproductive isolation
      result from the accumulation by natural selection of partially recessive or
      underdominant mutations. We also describe a method that allows genetic analysis
      of reproductive isolation between species that produce completely sterile or
      inviable hybrids. Such species pairs, which represent the final stage of
      speciation, cannot be analyzed by traditional methods. The X chromosome also
      plays an important role in postzygotic isolation between these species.

TI  - Expression of dispersed 36 bp sequences in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 374-80
AB  - A major fraction of mobile dispersed elements described in Drosophila virilis
      (pDv elements) consists of tandem 36 bp repeats. These repeat units were cloned
      into pUC19 and used as a hybridization probe. DNA blotting showed that these 36
      bp repeats in the D. virilis genome are included in rather large (5-6 kb)
      structural and probably functional domains. The 36 bp repeat units in the D.
      virilis and D. lummei genomes exist in three different orientations relative to
      one another, i.e. tail-to-tail, tail-to-head and head-to-head. These repeats are 
      actively transcribed and, as shown by in situ hybridization studies and RNA
      blotting, most of their transcripts are found in nuclei. Cloning of tandem
      repeats into bacterial expression vectors (pEX) with subsequent immunoblotting
      revealed translation of these sequences predominantly in one of the three
      possible reading frames.

      electrophoresis, we have detected genetic variation at 6 loci which coding for
      enzymes in 4 local samples from natural population of Drosophila virilis. We
      found 50% of the loci detected are polymorphic, depending on the criterion of
      polymorphism used. An individual is heterozygotes on the average at 27.13% of its
      loci. The amount of genetic variation fluctuates widely from locus to locus. At
      Est-alpha, Est-beta, Amy, most of the individuals are heterozygotes. At the other
      extreme , Mdh, aGpdh, Acph, few individuals are heterozygotes. For Mdh, we have
      measured the thermostability at 53 degrees C. No more genetic variation was
      found. We have measured the amount of genetic differentiation between different
      local populations. The result showed that there is no relationship between
      geographical distance and genetic distance. The results are discussed in the
      light of the continuing controversy over selection and natural theories of
      genetic variation. We think that both selection and stochastic processes must
      operate simultaneously in most systems.

TI  - Inheritance of cold shock tolerance in hybrids of Drosophila virilis and
      Drosophila lummei.
PG  - 17-25
AB  - The genetic basis of the difference in cold shock tolerance between the southern 
      temperate Drosophila virilis and its boreal relative D. lummei is studied. After 
      adult eclosion, the parental stocks, reciprocal F1 and backcross hybrids were
      pretreated for eight days at 18 degrees C or at 6 degrees C. The cold shock used 
      consisted of fast cooling to -10 degrees C and exposure to this temperature for
      varying lengths of time. D. lummei tolerated such exposure for 40-50% longer than
      did D. virilis (100-135% after acclimation). Reciprocal F1 females, differing
      only in their maternal cytoplasm deviated significantly from each other, and the 
      reciprocal F1 males even more so, the contribution of the X chromosome being
      three to four times that of the cytoplasm. The cold resistance scores of the
      hybrid males were more extreme than those of the parental stocks. Autosomally
      heterozygous males with the X chromosome and cytoplasm of virilis were the
      weakest flies studied. The reciprocal males (X chromosome and cytoplasm of
      lummei) survived better than the parental lummei stock. The reciprocal
      differences decreased after cold temperature acclimation. The roles of the four
      major autosomes were analyzed by backcrossing the reciprocal F1 males with
      females of the virilis marker stock. The third chromosome of lummei as
      heterozygous contributed most to cold tolerance, while the other autosomes had a 
      rather weak effect in the opposite direction (virilis homozygotes survived
      better), which disappeared after acclimation at 6 degrees C. Some of the cold
      susceptibility of F1 hybrids disappeared in chromosomally identical backcross
      flies, indicating complex cytoplasm-chromosomal interactions.

AB  - We have analyzed the cis-acting regulatory sequences of the Rh1 (ninaE) gene in
      Drosophila melanogaster by P-element-mediated germline transformation of
      indicator genes transcribed from mutant ninaE promoter sequences. We have
      previously shown that a 200-bp region extending from -120 to +67 relative to the 
      transcription start site is sufficient to obtain eye-specific expression from the
      ninaE promoter. In the present study, 22 different 4-13-bp sequences in the
      -120/+67 promoter region were altered by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis.
      Several of these sequences were found to be required for proper promoter
      function; two of these are conserved in the promoter of the homologous gene
      isolated from the related species Drosophila virilis. Alteration of a conserved
      9-bp sequence results in aberrant, low level expression in the body. Alteration
      of a separate 11-bp sequence, found in the promoter regions of several
      photoreceptor-specific genes of Drosophila, results in an approximately 15-fold
      reduction in promoter efficiency but without apparent alteration of
      tissue-specificity. A protein factor capable of interacting with this 11-bp
      sequence has been detected by DNaseI footprinting in embryonic nuclear extracts. 
      Finally, we have further characterized two separable enhancer sequences
      previously shown to be required for normal levels of expression from this
      promoter.

PG  - 687-704
AB  - The kinetic characteristics of the main isozymes of Drosophila virilis esterase
      were studied and Km values of esterase-2, -4, and -6 and p-esterase for alpha-
      and beta-naphthyl acetate were obtained. Juvenile hormone (JH) was shown to
      inhibit the p-esterase activity when in competition with beta-naphthyl acetate
      and the general esterase inhibitor, diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DFP), was shown
      to inhibit all the components of the D. virilis esterase patterns except
      p-esterase. While studying the changes of p-esterase activity in D. virilis
      ontogenesis, the increase in p-esterase activity in the wandering larvae,
      prepupae, and early pupae was found to correlate with a decrease in JH titer at
      these stages. The decrease in JH level in a temperature-sensitive lethal mutant
      larvae of D. virilis at high temperatures was shown to correlate with increased
      p-esterase activity. These results confirm that p-esterase of D. virilis is
      JH-esterase.

TI  - In situ digestion of Drosophila virilis polytene chromosomes by AluI and HaeIII
      restriction endonucleases.
PG  - 630-4
AB  - Polytene chromosomes of Drosophila virilis were treated with AluI and HaeIII
      restriction endonucleases. Both enzymes were capable of extensively digesting
      chromosomal DNA, with the exception of some regions that contain repetitive DNAs.
      Moreover, a comparison was made between our data and the data already obtained
      with the same enzymes in D. melanogaster. On this basis, AluI digestion showed
      that the 5S RNA genes of D. virilis and D. melanogaster have different base
      composition, while digestion with HaeIII revealed resistance of the histone genes
      in D. virilis, contrary to what was previously found in D. melanogaster.

TI  - THE GENETIC BASIS OF EVOLUTION OF THE MALE COURTSHIP SOUNDS IN THE DROSOPHILA
      VIRILIS GROUP.
PG  - 827-845
LID - 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1987.tb05856.x [doi]
AB  - When courting, males of the Drosophila virilis group vibrate their wings and emit
      species-specific courtship sounds consisting of trains of polycyclic sound
      pulses. To analyze the genetic basis of evolutionary changes in the sounds we
      made an F1 diallel set of reciprocal crosses between the members of the virilis
      phylad of the group (two stocks of D. virilis and one of D. americana americana, 
      D. a. texana, D. novamexicana, and D. lummei). We also crossed the D. virilis
      stocks with the members of the montana phylad of the same group (D. kanekoi, D.
      littoralis, D. borealis, D. flavomontana, D. lacicola, and D. montana) and made a
      backcross (D. virilis x D. littoralis) x D. virilis using a D. virilis marker
      stock (b; sv t tb gp; cd; pe). The sounds of the hybrids were analyzed using the 
      following parameters: the length of a pulse train (PTL), the number of pulses in 
      a train (PN), the interpulse interval (IPI), the length of a pulse (PL), the
      number of cycles in a pulse (CN), and the length of a cycle (CL). In the virilis 
      phylad, the differences between species appeared to be determined mainly by
      autosomal genes in each sound trait. The heritabilities (narrow-/broad-sense)
      obtained from the diallel tables were the following: PTL 0.662/0.817, PN
      0.651/0.841, IPI 0.193/0.546, PL 0.408/0.552, CN 0.425/0.719, and CL 0.361/0.764.
      The direction of dominance is for longer PTL, higher PN and CN, and shorter IPI
      and CL. PL shows ambidirectional dominance. In the sounds of the virilis phylad
      species, PTL and PL seem to be phenotypically the most important parameters,
      since their components (PN and IPI for PTL, CN and CL for PL) are negatively
      correlated. In crosses between D. virilis and D. littoralis or D. flavomontana
      reciprocal hybrids differed from each other in PTL, IPI, PL, and CN indicating
      X-chromosomal or cytoplasmic inheritance. In the backcrosses between D. virilis
      and D. littoralis the role of the X chromosome was ascertained to be decisive. We
      conclude that an X-chromosomal major change allowing variation in IPI has
      occurred during the separation of the two D. virilis group phylads, the long IPI 
      allowing variation also in PL (and CN). The evolution of the sounds in the
      virilis phylad has probably gone towards longer and denser pulse trains, while in
      the montana phylad the sounds have evolved in different directions.

TI  - Comparison of purified acid phosphatase allozymes in Drosophila virilis:
      differences in carbohydrate content and composition of the allozymes.
PG  - 415-28
AB  - Three acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) allozymes (ACPH1, ACPH2, and ACPH4) of
      Drosophila virilis show different activities as measured by electrophoretic
      techniques. Recently, it was suggested that these differences are attributable to
      the variable ability of the allozymes to be incorporated into lysosomes (Narise, 
      S., Genet. Res. Cambr., 45:143, 1985). Immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated that
      the activity differences between these electrophoretic variants coincided with
      differences in the amount of the enzyme protein in soluble fractions but not in
      whole cell-free extracts. These results support the idea that acid phosphatase
      allozymes in D. virilis are cell-localization variants. We examined the problem
      by structural analysis of both the protein and the carbohydrate moieties of these
      allozyme glycoproteins, since lysosomal enzymes are known to become localized in 
      lysosomes through their carbohydrate moieties. The three ACPH allozymes were
      purified to homogeneity from their respective homozygotes and compared with
      respect to amino acid composition and carbohydrate content and composition. Amino
      acid compositions were similar, while content and compositions of neutral sugars 
      were significantly different. The neutral sugar content of ACPH1 was 9.2%; that
      of ACPH2, 21.0%; and that of ACPH4, 7.3%. A trace of hexosamines, but no
      N-acetylneuraminic acid, was found in the ACPH allozymes. Isoelectric points
      varied corresponding to their electrophoretic mobilities, which were not changed 
      by treatment with alkaline phosphatase and neuraminidase.

PG  - 116-25
AB  - The sequence of a segment of the Drosophila virilis mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
      molecule that contains the A + T-rich region, the small rRNA gene, the
      tRNA(f-met), tRNA(gln), and tRNA(ile) genes, and portions of the ND2 and
      tRNA(val) genes is presented and compared with the corresponding segment of the
      D. yakuba mtDNA molecule. The A + T-rich regions of D. virilis and D. yakuba
      contain two correspondingly located sequences of 49 and 276/274 nucleotides that 
      appear to have been conserved during evolution. In each species the replication
      origin of the mtDNA molecule is calculated to lie within a region that overlaps
      the larger conserved sequence, and within this overlap is found a potential
      hairpin structure. Substitutions between the larger conserved sequences of the A 
      + T-rich regions, the small mt-rRNA genes, and the ND2 genes are biased in favor 
      of transversions, 71-97% of which are A----T changes. There is a 13.8 times
      higher frequency of nucleotide differences between the 5' halves than between the
      3' halves of the D. virilis and D. yakuba small mt-rRNA genes. Considerations of 
      the effects of observed substitutions and deletion/insertions on possible
      nucleotide pairing within the small mt-rRNA genes of D. virilis and D. yakuba
      strongly support the secondary structure model for the Drosophila small mt-rRNA
      that we previously proposed.

AB  - The dopa decarboxylase gene (Ddc) has been isolated from Drosophila virilis and
      introduced into the germ-line of Drosophila melanogaster by P-element mediated
      transformation. The integrated gene is induced at the correct stages during
      development with apparently normal tissue specificity, indicating that cis-acting
      elements required for regulation are functionally conserved between the two
      species. A comparison of the DNA sequences from the 5' flanking regions reveals a
      cluster of small (8-16 bp) conserved sequence elements within 150 bp upstream of 
      the RNA startpoint, a region required for normal expression of the D.
      melanogaster Ddc gene.

TI  - Satellite DNA-correlated nucleosomal proteins in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 79-92
AB  - Three major satellite DNAs comprise 40-45% of the genome of Drosophila virilis.
      Since these satellites are not substrates for most restriction enzymes, we were
      able to digest D. virilis nuclei with HaeIII and micrococcal nuclease and isolate
      chromatin fractions containing variable levels of satellite DNA. Electrophoretic 
      analysis of these chromatin fractions revealed that the level of the acid-soluble
      chromosomal protein, cp17.3, was directly related to the percentage of satellite 
      DNA in chromatin. The correlation between cp17.3 and satellite DNA abundance
      suggests that cp17.3 is involved in the heterochromatic condensation of satellite
      DNAs. cp17.3 occurs at a frequency of one molecule per 10-20 nucleosomes. It is
      detected in an electrophoretically distinguishable class of mononucleosomes,
      provisionally identified as MN1uH2A, which contains ubiquitinated histone H2A
      (uH2a) but lacks histone H1. It is not detected in MN1, a second class of
      mononucleosomes, which lacks uH2A and H1. Since cp17.3 is correlated with
      satellite DNAs and present in nucleosome cores, it might be a histone variant
      specifically associated with satellite DNAs.

TI  - Drosophila virilis histone gene clusters lacking H1 coding segments.
PG  - 149-58
AB  - Approximately 30-40% of Drosophila virilis DNA complementary to cloned Drosophila
      histone genes is reduced to 3.4-kilobase-pair (kbp) segments by Bgl I or Bgl II
      digestion. The core histone genes of a 3.4-kbp Bgl II segment cloned in the
      plasmid pDv3/3.4 have the same order as the D. melanogaster core histone genes in
      the plasmid cDm500: H2B H3 H4 H2A. Nonetheless, pDv3/3.4 and cDm500 have
      different histone gene configurations: In pDv3/3.4, the region between the H2B
      and H3 genes contains 0.35 kbp and cannot encode histone H1; in cDm500, the
      region contains 2.0 kbp and encodes histone H1. The lack of an H1 gene between
      the H2B and H3 genes in 30-40% of D. virilis histone gene clusters suggests that 
      changes in histone gene arrays have occurred during the evolution of Drosophila. 
      The ancestors of modern Drosophila may have possessed multiple varieties of
      histone gene clusters, which were subsequently lost differentially in the virilis
      and melanogaster lineages. Alternatively, they may have possessed a single
      variety, which was rearranged during evolution. The H1 genes of D. virilis and D.
      melanogaster did not cross-hybridize in vitro under conditions that maintain
      stable duplexes between DNAs that are 75% homologous. Consequently, D. virilis H1
      genes could not be visualized by hybridization to an H1-specific probe and thus
      remain unidentified. Our observations suggest that the coding segments in the H1 
      genes of D. virilis and D. melanogaster are greater than 25% divergent.(ABSTRACT

PG  - 3600-9
AB  - Physical localization of mutations in the engrailed (en) gene suggested that at
      least 70 kilobases (kb) of genomic sequences contribute to the normal function of
      this gene. Molecular characterization has suggested that en function is encoded
      in a small, 4.5-kb primary transcript. To identify functional regions within the 
      70 kb of the en locus of D. melanogaster, we identified sequences conserved in
      the D. virilis genome (estimated divergence time, 60 million years). Based on
      homology to D. melanogaster, we isolated en DNA from a D. virilis genomic
      library. Electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis indicated that in 70 kb there
      is 20 kb of conserved DNA in 33 different regions dispersed throughout the en
      locus, including two which encode parts of the major embryonic transcript. The
      conserved regions are in the same linear order and are spaced by similar lengths 
      of nonconserved sequences in the D. virilis and D. melanogaster DNAs. What
      functional constraints have enforced conservation of sequences throughout the
      entire 70 kb and protected the region from divergence of size and arrangement?
      Our working hypothesis is that sequences necessary for the complex spatial and
      temporal pattern of en expression are dispersed throughout the 70-kb en locus and
      that selection for proper regulation restricts evolutionary divergence.

TI  - Electron microscopic evidence for RNA polymerase loading at repeated sequences in
      non-transcribed spacers of D. virilis.
PG  - 181-90
AB  - The organization of transcribed and non-transcribed sequences in
      transcriptionally active ribosomal DNA (rDNA) chromatin from Drosophila virilis
      nurse cells (excluding follicle cells) was examined by electron microscopy.
      Nuclear spread preparations revealed that the actively transcribing rRNA genes
      (rTUs) exhibited a single uniform length distribution (7 +/- 0.5 kb).
      Non-transcribed 'spacer' regions separating active rTUs were, on the other hand, 
      quite heterogeneous in length with a mean of 1.95 +/- 1.4 kilobase pairs (kb).
      Within each 'spacer' segment of chromatin two morphologically distinct regions
      were discernable: (1) A fiber-free region adjacent to the 3' termination site of 
      the preceding rTU which accounted for the majority of each non-transcribed
      'spacer'. This region was highly heterogeneous in length, and was termed the
      'Non-repetitive Spacer' (NRS). (2) A short region, largely uniform in length,
      which was located immediately 5' to each rTU. This region was covered by a linear
      array of RNA polymerase molecules with a few very short fibers. The arrangement
      of polymerase in these arrays and their proximity to rRNA coding sequences
      appeared to be morphologically indicative of multiple initiation sites which are 
      thought to be present in this region of the non-transcribed spacer as evidenced
      by direct sequence analysis (Coen, E S & Dover, G A, Nucl acid res 10 (1982) 1017
      and Miller, J R et al., Nucl acid res 11 (1983) 11) [6, 18]. The data suggest
      that the repeated sequences in the non-transcribed spacer region serve as
      multiple in vivo loading and/or initiation sites for RNA polymerase I. Our
      results further indicate that, although an estimated 75% of the ribosomal RNA
      genes in Drosophila virilis are interrupted by an intron in the 28Sb gene
      sequence (Barnett, T & Rae, P M M, Cell 16 (1979) 763) [1], none of those genes
      appear to be transcribed to any appreciable extent in the tissues examined. It is
      also reasonable to infer that the actively transcribing uninterrupted genes (and 
      therefore the intron-containing genes as well) are clustered and not randomly
      interspersed.

TI  - Further genetic variation at the esterase loci of Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 323-37
AB  - Reexamination of the electrophoretic mobilities of esterases encoded by the
      Est-alpha and the Est-beta alleles of Drosophila virilis was carried out in
      detail using both thin-layer agar gel and polyacrylamide slab gel
      electrophoresis. Many allelic products with fine differences in their
      electrophoretic mobilities were found and designated by a new system. Some
      esterases separable by the agar gel method were indistinguishable using the
      polyacrylamide gel method. But the polyacrylamide gel method uncovered two
      multiband homozygotes, alpha(d).77 and beta(d) 1.28. Some allelic frequencies on 
      the basis of the new designation were estimated in two natural populations. As a 
      result, it is proposed that the total scope of allelic variation at the two
      esterase loci of Drosophila virilis is composed of discrete distribution patterns
      of gene frequencies, each histogram of which shows a bell-shaped pattern.

PG  - 1991-9
AB  - The location of proteins on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Drosophila virilis
      was investigated by Me3 psoralen photoreaction of mitochondria isolated from
      embryos. After photoreaction the mtDNA was purified and the pattern of DNA
      cross-linking was determined by electron microscopy of the DNA under totally
      denaturing conditions. The transcribed regions of the mtDNA molecule contained
      some uncross-linked regions, but such regions were infrequent and randomly
      distributed. In contrast, the A + T-rich region around the origin of replication 
      of the mtDNA was usually protected from psoralen cross-linking. The data were
      best fit by two protected sites, each approximately 400 base pairs, compared to
      the four 400 base pair sites observed in the equivalent region of D. melanogaster
      mtDNA [Potter et al. (1980) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 4118-4122]. Thus this
      region of the mtDNA appears to be involved in a DNA-protein structure that is
      highly conserved even though the DNA sequence has diverged rapidly relative to
      protein-coding sequences.

PG  - 65-80
AB  - The content of JH-esterase was assayed by radial immunodiffusion in Drosophila
      virilis pupae under normal conditions and under the effects of extreme factors.
      It was found that JH-esterase content is the same (not different from the
      control) in pupae showing a high activity of the enzyme and in those not showing 
      it. These data are evidence for a gene controlling JH-esterase activity. It was
      also shown that a regulatory factor converts inactive into active JH-esterase
      when homogenates of pupae, with active and inactive forms, were mixed and
      incubated together. It was demonstrated that the source of the activating factor 
      is the larval brain. Sublines 147-R and 147-I were produced by introducing the
      second chromosome pair of stocks 103 and 101, which are heat resistant, into the 
      genome of individuals of stock 147, which is heat sensitive. Sublines 160-III,
      160-IV, 160-V, and 160-VI were produced by introducing the third, fourth, fifth, 
      and sixth chromosome pairs of stock 147 into the genome of stock 160S, which is
      heat-resistant. The results of analysis of JH-esterase activity and the viability
      of individuals of these sublines at high temperatures indicated that the gene
      regulating the activity of JH-esterase is located in the sixth chromosome of D.
      virilis.

AB  - We isolated clones from different types of genomic Drosophila virilis libraries
      by screening with mRNA labelled in vitro. The DNA regions of the clones showing
      cross-hybridization with the RNA were sequenced. All of them contained different 
      types of simple sequences, which most probably were solely responsible for the
      hybridization. We show that simple sequences and their transcription are not a
      phenomenon that is restricted to Drosophila. Simple sequences can be detected in 
      all eucaryotes and at least three types (poly[d(G--T)] X poly[d(C--A)],
      poly[d(G--A)] X poly-[d(C--T)] and poly(dA) X poly(dT] are also widely
      transcribed.

AB  - In the TK strain of Drosophila virilis, age-associated changes in reproductive
      activities (copulating activity and fertility in males and egg-laying activity in
      females) and lifespan were examined in individual flies. The mean lifespan of
      individually aged flies was about 11 weeks for both males and females. Copulating
      activity was maximum in two-week old males, then decreased gradually and finally 
      ended at the age of 13 weeks at which about half of males were still surviving.
      Females also had a peak in egg-laying activity at the age of two weeks while no
      eggs were laid by females older than ten weeks, although more than half of
      females were alive at the stage. Analyses of the relationship between
      reproductive activity and lifespan of individual flies revealed that shorter
      lived males exhibited a higher copulating activity in the early stage of their
      lives than longer lived males. In males whose lifespan was less than ten weeks
      the reproductive period increased with the lifespan while the post-reproductive
      period was almost constant (one to two weeks). In males living longer than ten
      weeks, the reproductive period remained constant (about eight weeks) while the
      post-reproductive period increased in parallel with the total lifespan. Similar
      tendencies were also observed in the egg-laying activity of female flies.

TI  - Effect of mating status on Drosophila virilis lifespan.
PG  - 267-78
AB  - Mating status markedly affected the lifespan of Drosophila virilis flies but the 
      effects of virginity on lifespan were different between the sexes. In all cases
      lengthening of female lifespan and shortening of male lifespan were observed as
      an effect of virginity. Lifespan was also affected either by the population
      density or by the sex ratio per culture. At a sex ratio (proportion of females)
      of 0.5, lifespan was constant in both sexes irrespective of the population
      density and females lived significantly longer than males. At high (0.9) and low 
      (0.1) sex ratios mean lifespan did not differ between sexes, but it was longer at
      high sex ratios than at low ones. A negative correlation between mean lifespan
      and the number of males per vial was revealed for both sexes. Effects of mating
      on egg-laying activity were also analyzed. Although the number of eggs laid
      during the first 20 days period after eclosion was greater in mated females than 
      in unmated virgin females, lifetime egg production was not always larger in the
      former than in the latter. No particular relationship between egg-laying activity
      and female lifespan was proven. The lifespan of D. virillis flies seemed to be
      determined by complex interactions between both sexes, in which the sexual
      activity of males may play the most important role.

TI  - Genetics of esterases in Drosophila. VII. Genetic control of the activity level
      of juvenile hormone (JH)-esterase and heat resistance in D. virilis at high
      temperatures.
PG  - 253-65
AB  - The heat-resistant subline 147S was obtained in Drosophila virilis by selecting
      for viability individuals of heat-sensitive stock 147. It was shown that in the
      heat-treated 147S pupae the activity of juvenile hormone (JH)-esterase is
      decreased and, consequently, the titer of juvenile hormone is increased compared 
      with those in the control pupae. These changes are consistent with those observed
      earlier for resistant stock 101. Heat-resistant stocks 101 and 147S were crossed 
      with heat-sensitive stock 147, whose heat-treated larvae show earlier activation 
      and higher activity of JH-esterase than control larvae. The viability and
      electrophoretic esterase patterns were analyzed in the F1 and F2 hybrids at
      different temperatures. It was found that the F1 hybrid is resistant to the
      effect of high temperature and its activity level of JH-esterase is lower
      compared with controls. In the F2 hybrid, there was a 3:1 segregation of
      viability and a 1:2:1 segregation of the activity level of JH-esterase at high
      temperatures. It is concluded that the activity level of JH-esterase and heat
      resistance in D. virilis are monogenically controlled at high temperatures.

PG  - 1-7
AB  - We have cloned the gene for the esterase S isozymes complex from the genome of
      Drosophila virilis in pBR322. Esterase S is an enzyme which is specifically
      synthesized in the ejaculatory bulbs of D. virilis adult males. The gene for the 
      esterase S isozyme complex (estS) has been localized in band 2G5e of chromosome
      II. Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from ejaculatory bulbs actively hybridizes with this
      band. A cloned 15-kb fragment of D. virilis DNA (pVE9) also hybridizes with band 
      2G5e. The area encoding the poly(A)+ RNA is located in the middle part of the
      cloned fragment whose ends are not transcribed in vivo. Only one poly(A)+ RNA
      which is 1.9 kb long and complementary to pVE9 DNA can be revealed in the
      cytoplasm. The mRNA preselected by hybridization to pVE9 DNA was microinjected
      into the cytoplasm of Xenopus laevis oocytes. In other experiments, the pVE9 DNA 
      itself was microinjected into oocyte nuclei. In both cases, esterase S is
      synthesized in the oocytes, and the major part of the protein is transported from
      the oocytes and accumulated in the incubation medium.

TI  - DNA sequence divergence in the Drosophila virilis group.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - DNA sequence divergence was analyzed in some sibling species of the Drosophila
      virilis group. Clones comprising about 0.1% of the genome DNA were selected at
      random from a D. virilis library for a comparative study on DNA from D. lummei,
      D. novamexicana, D. borealis, and D. lacicola. Blot hybridization experiments
      indicated that about 70% of DNA from D. lummei and D. novamexicana and less than 
      50% of DNA from D. borealis and D. lacicola share sequences that are homologous
      to DNA in D. virilis. This finding is in excellent agreement with the
      genealogical tree based on cytological studies (Throckmorton 1982). - Four
      plasmids with inserts which are present in one or a few copies per genome were
      hybridized in situ to polytene chromosomes. These experiments demonstrate that
      (1) homologous "unique" DNA sequences are localized exclusively in homologous
      bands and (2) homologous bands that appear to be identical in different species
      may contain different DNA sequences.

AB  - Photooxidation is believed to preferentially remove guanine (G) residues from
      chromosomal DNA. G interspersion, moreover, has been hypothesized as quenching
      quinacrine (Q) fluorescence in cytological preparations. Hence, we used
      photooxidation as a tool for inducing possible changes in the Q-banding pattern
      of Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila virilis, and Mus musculus metaphase
      chromosomes. An enhanced Q fluorescence, which was particularly evident in
      certain chromosomal regions, was found. This finding would support the postulated
      primary role of G in determining Q bands in eukaryotic chromosomes.

PG  - 109-14
AB  - When rearing the D. virilis larvae on the nutrient medium with
      5-bromodeoxyuridine-6-3H (3H-BDU) at different developmental stages, it was found
      that the intensity of isotope incorporation in the chromosomes and cytoplasm of
      the salivary gland cells depended on the duration of effect and concentration.
      The distribution of label along the chromosomes does not occur at random. The
      spectrum of isotope incorporation is specific for each chromosome. All regions
      which changed their puffing pattern as a result of rearing the larvae on the
      medium with 3H-BDU incorporated the isotope and the frequency of incorporation in
      the most of them differed reliably from the random one. The intensity of
      incorporation increased with the duration of labelling and the isotope
      concentration.

      microscopes, office copy machines, and X-ray devices. Mutagenicity and action
      modus operandi of ozone suggest its radiomimetic property. In order to test for
      ozone-induced dominant lethals in Drosophila virilis, we determined that four-hr 
      and longer exposures to 30 +/- 2 ppm ozone were lethal on or before day 25
      postexposure. Accordingly, we used a three-hr ozone exposure to investigate
      dominant lethals induced at specific spermatogenic stages. Ozone increased the
      percentage of dominant lethals in the stages of spermatogenesis which were
      investigated. Under the conditions of this experiment, the sperm-sperm bundle
      stage showed the greatest percentage of dominant lethals induced by ozone.
      Meiotic cells were the least sensitive to ozone mutagenicity. The induction of
      dominant lethals is discussed on the basis of chemical reactions from the
      molecular decomposition of water by radiations and/or ozone. Alternative
      explanations are presented due to the definition of induced dominant lethals and 
      to associated modifications from ozone exposure.

AB  - The biochemical properties of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase of two different
      Drosophila species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila virilis, were studied and 
      compared with those of Drosophila melanogaster Adhs enzyme. All of them consist
      of two identical subunits of molecular weight 27800 and share significant
      similarities in function. The substrate specificities of these enzymes were
      characterized and Km(app.) and Vmax.(app.) values were calculated. All these
      alcohol dehydrogenases show greater affinity for secondary rather than for
      primary alcohols. The amino acid compositions of the three enzymes were
      determined, and there is a close similarity between the D. simulans and the D.
      melanogaster enzymes, but there are significant differences from the alcohol
      dehydrogenase of D. virilis. The N-terminal amino acid is blocked and the
      C-terminal amino acid is the same for all three alcohol dehydrogenases. The
      enzymes from the three species were carboxymethylated and digested with trypsin. 
      The peptide 'maps' reveal, as expected, more homologies between the enzymes of D.
      simulans and D. melanogaster than with the enzyme of D. virilis.

AB  - Thermal stability of alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase-1 (alpha-Gpdh-1) in
      nine Drosophila species was studied at pH's ranging form 6.4 to 8.5. This was
      done by measuring the changes in the activity of enzymes during the heat
      denaturation process. In addition to temperature, the rate of denaturation is
      highly dependent on the pH of the incubation buffer. The results of this study
      show that the thermal stability of enzyme molecules is different in different
      species. This holds true also in the species in which the enzymes have been found
      to be identical by other means. The differences between species of the Drosophila
      virilis group are discussed.

      fluorescent microscopy, these sequences are consistently found to be located on
      the sides of the nuclei nearest to the vitelline membrane. This arrangement of
      the A-T rich sequences has been observed from the syncytial balstoderm stage into
      the gastrula stage where, in each nucleus, the satellite DNA sequences remain at 
      a point nearest the topological outside of the organism.

TI  - Chromosomal replication in Drosophila virilis. III. Organization of active
      origins in the highly polytene salivary gland cells.
PG  - 289-307
AB  - Using DNA fiber autoradiography, the rate of fork movement in D. virilis salivary
      glands was determined to be 0.1 micron/ml (25 degrees C). This value is 3.5 times
      slower than the replication rate determined in the diploid brain cells using the 
      same experimental conditions (Steinemann, 1981). Replicon lengths in the polytene
      cells span from 5 to 203 micron, with a mean of approximately x = 46.7 micron and
      a median of approximately x = 39.5 micron. The polytene replicon length is about 
      the same as that for diploid brain cells (31.0 micron). Dividing the haploid
      genome of D. virilis by the estimated number of 5,000 bands and taking the
      resulting 13.6 micron as average DNA length per chromomere, the average replicon 
      length covers 3.4 chromomere units. This result does not support the concept that
      "one-band-plus interband" behaves as a replicating unit (Pelling, 1966). From the
      positive skew of the replicon length distributions, combined with the results
      derived from the chromosomal labelling patterns, the following schedule of
      chromosomal euchromatin doubling is infered: A short initiation period
      (discontinuous phase I), asynchronous with respect to individual origins, is
      followed by a phase of common replication activity at all inducible origins
      (continuous phase). The discontinuous II pattern is formed by few, long replicons
      which are still replicating while the shorter ones have already finished (weak
      points are not considered). Replicons, distributed in the main peak of the
      histogram and smaller than about 100 micron, are then responsible for the
      replication of the bulk of chromosomal euchromatin, the continuous phase. the
      interpretation is in conflict with the hypothesis assuming a clustered
      organization of the replicons to explain spot labelling (reviewed in Hand 1978). 
      The diploid karyotype of D. virilis contains 45% satellite sequences, located in 
      the alpha-heterochromatin (Gall et al., 1971). They do not replicate in the
      highly polytene salivary gland cells of 3rd instar larvae. Comparison of DNA
      fiber autoradiograph patterns from salivary glands and brains suggests that these
      satellite sequences replicate in short (less than 10 micron), to some extent
      irregularly spaced replicons.

PG  - 267-88
AB  - DNA fiber autoradiography was used to determine parameters underlying the DNA
      replication of the eukaryotic chromosome in Drosophila diploid brain cells organ 
      culture. The average rate of fork movement, estimated from 4 different labelling 
      intervals, is 0.35 micron/min at 25 degrees C. Of the tandem arrays 93% show
      patterns which are compatible with bidirectional replication, 7% show
      unidirectional replication. The unidirectional mode of replication is interpreted
      as being a consequence of the experimental schedule (using hot-cold pulse
      labelling) combined with the occurrence of termination signals. - Some
      autoradiograms showed the expected two grain tracks of different densities;
      others showed only a high density track. The latter were most prominent in arrays
      of short replicons (less than 10 micron) which correlate with replicating
      satellite sequences. - The majority of replicons fall into size classes less than
      100 micron. The frequency distribution is skewed towards larger replicon sizes;
      it spans 2-238 micron, has a mean of x = 25.6 micron and a median of
      approximately 21.0 micron. If the distribution is corrected for supposed
      satellite replicons, the median increases of approximately 31.0 micron. - In
      experiments using warm-hot pulse labelling, arrays were scored which must have
      been a consequence of fixed termination signals. Furthermore, grain tracks
      diverging from weak labelled centers often have different lengths, indicating
      that these replicons contain two diverging replicating sections of unequal
      length.

TI  - Nontranscribed spacers in Drosophila ribosomal DNA.
PG  - 637-55
AB  - Ribosomal DNA nontranscribed spacers in Drosophila virilis DNA have been examined
      in some detail by restriction site analysis of cloned segments of rDNA, nucleic
      acid hybridizations involving unfractionated rDNA, and base composition
      estimates. The overall G + C content of the spacer is 27--28%; this compares with
      39% for rDNA as a whole, 40% for main band DNA, and 26% for the D. virilis
      satellites. Much of the spacer is comprised of 0.25 kb repeats revealed by
      digestion with Msp I, Fnu DII or Rsd I, which terminate very near the beginning
      of the template for the ribosomal RNA precursor. The spacers are heterogeneous in
      length among rDNA repeats, and this is largely accounted for by variation among
      rDNA units in the number of 0.25 kb elements per spacer. Despite its high A + T
      content and the repetitive nature of much of the spacer, and the proximity of
      rDNA and heterochromatin in Drosophila, pyrimidine tract analysis gave no
      indication of relatedness between the spacer and satellite DNA sequences. Species
      of Drosophila closely related to D. virilis have rDNA spacers that are homologous
      with those in D. virilis to the extent that hybridization of a cloned spacer
      segment of D. virilis rDNA to various DNA is comparable with hybridization to
      homologous DNA, and distributions of restriction enzyme cleavage sites are very
      similar (but not identical) among spacers of the various species. There is spacer
      length heterogeneity in the rDNA of all species, and each species has a unique
      major rDNA spacer length. Judging from Southern blot hybridization, D. hydei rDNA
      spacers have 20--30% sequence homology with D. virilis rDNA spacers, and a
      repetitive component is similarly sensitive to Msp I and Fnu DII digestion. D.
      melanogaster rDNA spacers have little or no homology with counterparts in D.
      virilis rDNA, despite a similar content of 0.25 kb repetitive elements. In
      contrast, sequences in rDNA that encode 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA have been
      highly conserved during the divergence of Drosophila species; this is inferred
      from interspecific hybridizations involving ribosomal RNA and a comparison of
      distributions of restriction enzyme cleavage sites in rDNA.

      form; 35 000--37 000 for subunit) and Michaelis constants for NADH, glycerol
      3-phosphate and NAD+ (5.3--6.0 microM for NADH; 1.8--1.9 mM for glycerol
      3-phosphate; 100--110 microM for NAD+). Significant differences among three forms
      were observed in thermostability at 35 degrees C and inhibition by excess of
      dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The alpha GPDHf form was found to be most
      thermolabile and the alpha GPDHs form most susceptible to the inhibition.

TI  - The 10 kb Drosophila virilis 28S rDNA intervening sequence is flanked by a direct
      repeat of 14 base pairs of coding sequence.
PG  - 3491-504
AB  - Most repeat units of rDNA in Drosophila virilis are interrupted in the 28S rRNA
      coding region by an intervening sequence about 10 kb in length; uninterrupted
      repeats have a length of about 11 kb. We have sequenced the coding/intervening
      sequence junctions and flanking regions in two independent clones of interrupted 
      rDNA, and the corresponding 28S rRNA coding region in a clone of uninterrupted
      rDNA. The intervening sequence is terminated at both ends by a direct repeat of a
      fourteen nucleotide sequence that is present once in the corresponding region of 
      an intact gene. This is a phenomenon associated with transposable elements in
      other eukaryotes and in prokaryotes, and the Drosophila rDNA intervening sequence
      is discussed in this context. We have compared more than 200 nucleotides of the
      D. virilis 28S rRNA gene with sequences of homologous regions of rDNA in
      Tetrahymena pigmentosa (Wild and Sommer, 1980) and Xenopus laevis (Gourse and
      Gerbi, 1980): There is 93% sequence homology among the diverse species, so that
      the rDNA region in question (about two-thirds of the way into the 28S rRNA coding
      sequence) has been very highly conserved in eukaryote evolution. The intervening 
      sequence in T. pigmentosa is at a site 79 nucleotides upstream from the insertion
      site of the Drosophila intervening sequence.

AB  - Three alcohol dehydrogenases from Drosophila simulans, Drosophila virillis and
      Drosophila melanogaster adhS (which possesses an alloenzyme with slow
      electrophoretic mobility) were purified essentially to homogeneity. The
      purification procedure involves a new step of affinity chromatography, which
      efficiently lowers the amount of contaminants in the final preparation, producing
      a very stable enzyme. The purification procedure developed consists of a salmine 
      sulphate precipitation, two CM-Sepharose CL-6B colume-chromatography steps, an
      affinity-chromatography step and a Sephacryl gel filtration. A minimum of 30-fold
      purification is obtained and the yield is not less than 34%. The isoelectric
      points and molar absorption coefficients were determined.

TI  - Evoluation of Drosophila mitochondrial DNAs. Analysis of heteroduplex molecules.
PG  - 342-51
AB  - We have mapped the single block of non-homologous sequences and measured the
      extent and distribution of base-pair substitutions within the homologous
      sequences in Drosophila melanogaster: Drosophila virilis heteroduplex
      mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs). Of the 4.8 kilobases long, unusually (A + T)-rich
      region in D. melanogaster mtDNA, only 0.5 kilobases can react with related, but
      not identical sequences in D. virilis mtDNA, while the rest (4.3 kilobases in the
      long arm of a heteroduplex loop) is replaced by a shorter, non-homologous region 
      (1.0 kilobases in the short arm of the loop). No additional heterologous regions 
      are evident. Homologous sequences have accumulated on the average 15.5% base-pair
      changes. Regionally, these substitutions are relatively uniformly distributed
      (14.5--16.5%) except for a single, more conserved region (10--13%), which
      presumably represents the ribosomal cistrons. The lack of general sequence
      stability suggests that the invariant topographic organization of the nucleotide 
      sequence, previously recognized among Drosophila mtDNAs, is under more stringent 
      selection than the sequence per se.

TI  - Detection and location of three simple sequence DNAs in polytene chromosomes from
      virilis group species of Drosophila.
PG  - 327-55
AB  - In vitro synthesized RNAs complementary to the three satellite DNAs of Drosophila
      virilis have been used in a series of in situ hybridization experiments with
      polytene chromosomes from virilis group species. Gall and Atherton (1974)
      demonstrated that each of the satellites of D. virilis is comprised of many
      repeats of a distinct, seven base pair long, simple sequence. With few
      exceptions, copies of each of these simple sequences are detected in the
      chromocenters of all virilis group species. This is true even in species which do
      not possess satellite DNAs at buoyant densities corresponding to those of the
      satellite DNAs of D. virilis. Small quantities of the three simple sequences are 
      also detected in euchromatic arms of several different species. The same
      euchromatic location may contain detectable copies of one, two, or all three
      simple sequence DNAs. The amounts of simple sequences at each location in the
      euchromatin may vary between species, between different stocks of the same
      species, and even between individuals of the same stock. The simple sequences
      located in the euchromatin appear to undergo DNA replication during formation of 
      polytene chromosomes unlike those in heterochromatin. The locations of the
      euchromatic sequences are not the results of single chromosomal inversion events 
      involving heterochromatic and euchromatic breakpoints.

TI  - Absence of cytosine methylation at C-C-G-G and G-C-G-C sites in the rDNA coding
      regions and intervening sequences of Drosophila and the rDNA of other insects.
PG  - 2987-95
AB  - Cytosine residues in C-G dinucleotides are frequently methylated in eukaryote
      DNA. In DNA of the dinoflagellate C. cohnii, the sequence C-MeC-G-G apparently
      renders Hpa II (C-C-G-G) incapable of digesting whole cell DNA in general, and
      rDNA in particular. Msp I, which also recognizes C-C-G-G but cleaves irrespective
      of methylation, degrades C. cohnii DNA and produces rDNA segments of 10.2 to 1.4 
      kb. We have applied this Hpa II/Msp I test to unfractionated DNA, and to rDNA and
      the rDNA intervening sequence of Drosophila virilis embryos and adults. There is 
      no evidence of C-MeC-G-G sequences in either developmental stage of this species.
      Absence of G-MeC-G-C from coding and intervening sequences of rDNA was shown in
      comparisons of Hha I (G-C-G-C) cleavage patterns of unfractionated DNA and cloned
      (unmodified) segments of rDNA. Comparisons of Hpa II and Msp I cleavage products 
      of DNA from the house fly, the flesh fly and a bumblebee also revealed no
      internal cytosine methylation in the sequence C-C-G-G. Because amounts of McC in 
      C-G dinucleotides vary greatly among species, from apparent nonexistence to
      substantial proportions, no inference may yet be drawn about the role of such
      base modifications in DNA.

PG  - 433-44
AB  - Two allozymes (MDHf and MDHs) of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase of Drosophila
      virilis were partially purified and their biochemical properties were compared.
      MDHf has a pH optimum of 9.75 and MDHs one of 9.25 for malate oxidation. Optimal 
      pH for oxaloacetate reduction is 6.75 and 8.0 for MDHf and MDHs, respectively.
      The Km value for oxaloacetate of MDHs is approximately twice as that of MDHf. No 
      differences were found with respect to thermostability and Km's for malate, NAD+,
      or NADH. These results are discussed in terms of the physiological role of
      cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase of D. virilis.

      interruptions of diverse species of Drosophila and other diptera.
PG  - 763-75
AB  - A large proportion of the 28S ribosomal RNA genes in Drosophila virilis are
      interrupted by a DNA sequence 9.6 kilobase pairs long. As regards both its
      presence and its position in the 28S gene (about two thirds of the way in), the
      D. virilis rDNA intervening sequence is similar to that found in D. melanogaster 
      rDNA, but lengths differ markedly between the two species. Degrees of nucleotide 
      sequence homology have been detected bewteen rDNA interruptions of the two
      species. This homology extends to putative rDNA intervening sequences in diverse 
      higher diptera (other Drosophila species, the house fly and the flesh fly), but
      hybridization of cloned D. melanogaster and D. virilis rDNA interruption segments
      to DNA of several lower diptera has been negative. As is the case with
      melanogaster rDNA interruptions, segments of the virilis rDNA intervening
      sequence hybridize with non-rDNA components of the virilis genome, and
      interspecific homology may involve these non-rDNA sequences as well as rDNA
      interruptions. There is, however, evidence from buoyant density fractionation of 
      DNA that the distributions of interruption-related sequences are distinct in D.
      melanogaster and D. virilis genomes. Moreover, thermal denaturation studies have 
      indicated differing extents of homology between hybridizable sequences in D.
      virilis DNA and different segments of the D. melanogaster rDNA intervening
      sequence. We infer from our studies that rDNA intervening sequences are prevalent
      among higher diptera; that in the course of the evolution of these organisms,
      elements of the intervening sequences have been moderately to highly conserved;
      and that this conservation extends in at least two distantly related species of
      Drosophila to similar sequences found elsewhere in the genomes.

TI  - Anomalous electrophoretic mobility of Drosophila phosphorylated H1 histone: is it
      related to the compaction of satellite DNA into heterochromatin?
PG  - 2151-64
AB  - In embryonic nuclei of Drosophila virilis, 45% of the DNA is satellite, and
      congruent to 50% of the H1 histone is phosphorylated. In polytene salivary gland 
      nuclei, less than 1% of the DNA is satellite, and less than 10tion. The
      phosphorylated H1's migrate 4% slower than the unphosphorylated H1's on
      SDS-acrylamide gels. The mobility difference may arise because the phosphorylated
      and unphosphorylated H1's have different conformations in SDS. This putative
      conformational difference could be essential to the compaction of satellite DNA
      into heterochromatin.

TI  - Glucosamine metabolism in Drosophila salivary glands. Separation of metabolites
      and some characteristics of three enzymes involved.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - The conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to mucopolysaccharide precursors was
      studied in extracts of Drosophila virilis salivary glands. 1. Methods for
      chromatography of sugar phosphates were adapted and modified to allow routine
      separation and quantitation of radioactivity of the metabolites from milligram
      amounts of tissue. Anion exchange chromatography was performed on Dowex 1-X8
      employing steps of increasing ammonium formate. Final isolation of each compound 
      was achieved by various thin-layer chromatographic systems. 2. Data obtained by
      isotope incorporation into glucosamine 6-phosphate compare well with results of
      the Morgan-Elson colorimetric assay for amino-sugars. 3. Glucosaminephosphate
      isomerase (glutamine-forming) (EC 5.3.1.19) in gland extracts has a Km of 0.35 mM
      for fructose 6-phosphate, and of 0.25 mM for glutamine. The enzyme is inhibited
      at glutamine concentrations exceeding 1 mM and by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (50% at
      0.6 mM). Feedback inhibition by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine is enhanced by AMP and by
      glucose 6-phosphate. 4. Glucosaminephosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.10) has a twenty
      fold lower affinity towards fructose 6-phosphate (Km = 6.0 mM) compared to the
      glutamine-forming isomerase. Km (NH+4) is 7.4 mM. In the presence of 20 mM
      glucose 6-phosphate, the pH optimum is shifted from 6.6 to 7.4, and V increased
      by a factor of 2.5. Furthermore, the affinity is approximately doubled for both
      substrates. 5. Glucosamine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.3) has a Km of 2 mM for
      glucoseamine 6-phosphate. Its activity is not rate-limiting in salivary glands.
      Since N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate and 1-phosphate were found near equilibrium
      concentrations, acetylglucosamine phosphomutase (EC 2.7.5.2) must also be present
      in the extracts.

TI  - Sensitivity of excitable and inexcitable membranes to alpha-dihydrograyanotoxin
      II.
PG  - C204-11
AB  - A variety of excitable and inexcitable preparations have been examined for their 
      sensitivity to the depolarizing action of alpha-dihydrograyanotoxin II.
      alpha-Dihydrograyanotoxin II was effective in producing membrane depolarization
      in giant axons from the crayfish (Procambarus clarki) and sartorius muscle fibers
      from the frog (Rana pipiens) and the salamander (Taricha torosa). The
      toxin-induced depolarization was reversed by lowering the external sodium
      concentration. High concentrations of tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin were also
      effective in reversing the depolarization in the various grayanotoxin-sensitive
      preparations studied except in the salamander sartorius muscle, in which
      sodium-dependent action potentials were highly resistant to tetrodotoxin and
      saxitoxin. In contrast, alpha-dihydrograyanotoxin II was ineffective in changing 
      the resting membrane potential in the muscle fibers of the crayfish (Procambarus 
      clarki and Orconectes virilis) and in the salivary gland giant cells from
      Drosophila virilis. Of the preparations that were examined, only the membranes
      that produce a sodium-dependent action potential are sensitive to the
      depolarizing action of alpha-dihydrograyanotoxin II.

TI  - Genetics of esterases in Drosophila. VI. Gene system regulating the phenotypic
      expression of the organ-specific esterase in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 709-26
AB  - It is shown that the gene controlling the synthesis of the organ-specific
      S-esterase of Drosophila virilis ejaculatory bulbs is located on the second
      chromosome (at approximate position 192.1 +/- map units). The cells of the
      genital imaginal disks are determined for the synthesis of S-esterase 10-12 hr
      after the second molt. The organ-specific esterase can be detected after adult
      emergence only. It is preceded by an increase in RNA content and by enhancement
      of RNA synthesis in the cells of the ejaculatory bulbs. Interstock differences
      were found in the level of the activity of S-esterase, which is under the control
      of the X chromosome, as well as in the time of expression of enzyme activity,
      which is controlled by the fifth chromosome. It is suggested that the specific
      phenotypic expression of this enzyme depends on the system of genes with
      regulatory expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.
      The genetic control of the synthesis of the S-esterase described is a convenient 
      model for studying mechanisms of gene activity regulation in eukaryotes.

TI  - A simple method for the computation of first neighbour frequencies of DNAs from
      CD spectra.
PG  - 2013-31
AB  - A procedure for the computation of the first neighbour frequencies of DNA's is
      presented. This procedure is based on the first neighbour approximation of Gray
      and Tinoco. We show that the knowledge of all the ten elementary CD signals
      attached to the ten double stranded first neighbour configurations is not
      necessary. One can obtain the ten frequencies of an unknown DNA with the use of
      eight elementary CD signals corresponding to eight linearly independent polymer
      sequences. These signals can be extracted very simply from any eight or more CD
      spectra of double stranded DNA's of known frequencies. The ten frequencies of a
      DNA are obtained by least square fit of its CD spectrum with these elementary
      signals. One advantage of this procedure is that it does not necessitate linear
      programming, it can be used with CD data digitalized using a large number of
      wavelengths, thus permitting an accurate resolution of the CD spectra. Under
      favorable case, the ten frequencies of a DNA (not used as input data) can be
      determined with an average absolute error < 2%. We have also observed that
      certain satellite DNA's, those of Drosophila virilis and Callinectes sapidus have
      CD spectra compatible with those of DNA's of quasi random sequence; these
      satellite DNA's should adopt also the B-form in solution.

TI  - Correlation between phosphorylated H1 histones and satellite DNAs in Drosophila
      virilis.
PG  - 866-70
AB  - Drosophila virilis DNA contains satellites I, II, and III. D. novamexicana DNA
      contains satellite I. D. virilis H1 histone contains subfractions a, b, c, d, and
      e; D. novamexicana H1 contains subfractions a, b, and c. Therefore, satellites II
      and III might be correlated with H1d and H1e. To test the validity of this
      correlation, the H1 histones of polytene nuclei, which contain less than 1%
      satellite DNA, were analyzed. Polytene nuclei of D. virilis contain substantially
      decreased levels of H1c and H1e and marginally decreased levels of H1d. Polytene 
      nuclei of D. novamexicana contain decreased levels of H1c.H1c is correlated with 
      satellite I (common to D. virilis and D. novamexicana); H1e is correlated with
      satellites II and III; H1d is not correlated with any satellite DNA, because its 
      level is virtually unchanged in polytene cells lacking detectable amounts of
      satellite DNA. Alkaline phosphatase digestion of the H1 histones reveals that H1c
      is the phosphorylated form of H1b and H1e is the phosphorylated form of H1d.
      Therefore, the under-replication of satellite DNAs is correlated with the
      decreased phosphorylation of H1 histones. In vitro, D. virilis H1 histones
      preferentially bind D. virilis DNAs in the progression III greater than II
      greater than I greater than main band, whereas D. virilis core histones do not
      preferentially bind any D. virilis DNA. As an extension of these results, we
      suggest that phosphorylated H1 histones bind D. virilis satellite DNAs in vivo
      and are involved in the compaction of heterochromatin.

TI  - Genetics of esterases in Drosophila. V. Characteristics of the "pupal" esterase
      in D. virilis.
PG  - 531-48
AB  - From analysis of the properties of the "pupal" esterase (p-esterase) in
      Drosophila virilis, it is concluded that it is heat stable, its electrophoretic
      detection depends on culture density, its expression is stage specific, and it is
      not a variant of esterase 2. It was also demonstrated that p-esterase, like
      esterase 6, is activated by injections of the juvenile hormone into larvae. Heat 
      treatment of heat-resistant D. virilis stocks led to decreased activities of the 
      juvenile hormone dependent esterases but did not affect those of the
      heat-sensitive stocks. It is suggested that heat resistance in D. virilis is
      related to some functional features of the system of modifier genes controlling
      the phenotypic expression of esterases.

AB  - 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) influences the differentiation of the imaginal discs, 
      larval viability and the chromosome puffing throughout the larval development.
      The differentiation of imaginal discs is more sensitive during the early 3rd
      instar. "cryptocephal" phenocopy appeared if the larvae were reared in the BUdR
      medium till the late 2nd instar. 2nd and 3rd instars are critical for the larval 
      viability. During the period of the middle 3rd instar BUdR induced the complete
      spectrum of the newly forming specific puffs.

      more sensitive to BUdR. The effect of BUdR becomes considerably lower by the end 
      of the 3rd instar period.

AB  - Drosophila melanogaster 5S ribosomal RNA labeled with 125I was used as an in situ
      hybridization probe to localize complementary sequences in chromosomes of species
      in the Drosophila virilis group. Whereas virilis, the ancestral species, has two 
      different 5S gene loci, the derived species show only one of these loci; in the
      two lines that have evolved from virilis it is the opposite locus that is
      conserved. The possible events leading to such an arrangement are discussed.

      genetic methods in F(1)Drosophila virilis x D. texana females (series I) and in
      D. virilis females carrying a D. texana fifth chromosome in heterozygous
      condition (series II). The main criterion utilized to distinguish the oogonial
      crossovers from the meiotic ones is the identity of cytological positions of
      genetic exchange in crossovers constituting a cluster. Five clusters of
      crossovers with identical positions of exchange were found in the first series of
      experiments. In the second series of experiments not a single cluster of
      crossovers resulting from oogonial crossing over was found.

AB  - The application of different DNA extraction methods to identical batches of
      Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster flies or embryos has revealed that
      the ionic strength of a homogenization medium is of critical importance if
      chloroform extractions are performed. The low yield of satellite DNA after
      homogenization in low salt buffers is less severe if EDTA is included in the
      buffer. Phenol extraction procedures result in no such differential behavior of
      satellite and main band DNA, but under certain circumstances a particular
      satellite fraction of Drosophila virilis DNA may be lost.

AB  - The DNA of Drosophila virilis brains and imaginal discs was labeled in vitro to a
      specific activity of 6 X 10(-5) dpm/mug, using an organ culture medium. The DNA
      was fractionated on neutral and alkaline CsC1 gradients and the heavy strands of 
      satellite I annealed in situ to denatured polytene chromosomes from squash
      preparations of larval salivary glands. Nuclease S1 from Aspergillus oryzae was
      used to digest the unpaired ssDNA, resulting in a distinct labeling of the
      alpha-heterochromatin in the chromocenter and a small amount of diffused labeling
      in the proximal beta-heterochromatic part of the X-Chromsome.

TI  - Genetic regulation of chromosome behaviour in interspecific hybrids of
      Drosophila.
PG  - 55-61
LID - 10.1007/BF00267312 [doi]
AB  - When crossing Drosophila virilis females with D. littoralis males, the
      elimination of D. littoralis sixth chromosome (microchromosomes) was often
      observed. The absence of the sixth chromosome of D. littoralis was revealed when 
      studying F1 hybrids, because of the mosaic expression of the recessive gene "gl",
      located in the sixth chromosome of D. virilis. In the reciprocal cross the
      elimination of the sixth chromosome of D. littoralis did not take place (Sokolov 
      1959).Genetic analysis enabled the authors to conclude that the observed maternal
      effect on mitosis is controlled by recessive genes located on the second and
      fourth chromosome of D. virilis. The genes located on the second chromosome,
      differ from those on the fourth chromosome both in temperature sensitivity and in
      the time and/ or the mechanism controlling the mitotic behaviour of the
      chromosomes.By means of back-crosses a new stock was established where all
      chromosomes except the sixth belonged to D. virilis. The sixth pair
      (microchromosomes) in this line was represented by one D. virilis and one D.
      littoralis chromosome. It was shown that the sixth chromosome of D. littoralis
      might be eliminated or undergo non-disjunction in D. virilis germline but the
      frequency of such atypical behaviour was very low (about 2 %). Low temperature
      treatment was not effective for increasing the frequency of either elimination or
      non-disjunction of the D. littoralis sixth chromosome in D. virilis germ-line.

TI  - Genetics of esterases in Drosophila. IV. Slow-migrating S-esterase in Drosophila 
      of the virilis group.
PG  - 161-82
AB  - A slow-migrating beta-esterase (S-esterase) is described which has been detected 
      in Drosophila montana, Drosophila imeretensis, and some stocks of Drosophila
      virilis when mixtures of alpha- and beta-naphthyl acetate are used as substrates 
      in histochemical reactions after electrophoresis. Sexual dimorphism for
      S-esterase has been demonstrated. This esterase is contained in male genitalia
      only, predominantly in the ejaculatory bulb (waxy plug). It appears 3-4 days
      after emergence of flies. In hybrids between S+ and So species, the activity of
      the slow esterase is either decreased or inhibited. An autonomous synthesis of
      the S- esterase in the ejaculatory bulb was established by transplantation of
      imaginal genital discs into larvae of different Drosophila stocks. Based on
      analysis of physiochemical and immunochemical properties, S-esterase is suggested
      to be an independent fraction of esterase, possibly dimeric, which does not
      cross-react with beta-esterase antiserum.

AB  - The synthesis of different RNA fractions labelled by 3H-uridine has been studied 
      at different developmental stages in Drosophila virilis by means of thermal
      phenol extraction and chromatography on oligo-alphaT-cellulose. There are two
      periods of intensive synthesis of poly-A containing (messenger) RNA in the course
      of embryogenesis. The former (6--12 hrs) is the period of gastrulation and
      stomodeum development and the latter (15--21 hrs) is the period of intensive
      differentiation of larval organs. The synthesis of poly-A free RNAs predominates 
      at the stages of blastoderm (2--5 hrs) and mesoderm segmentation and embryo
      shortening (12--15 hrs).

PG  - 189-92
AB  - The phenogenetics of a new temperature-sensitive mutation diskless-ts (dl-ts, 2nd
      chromosome) has been studied in D. virilis. The rearing of larvae from the 1st
      instar at the temperature 31 degrees resulted in the complete or partial arrest
      of the development of imaginal discs and, consequently, the death of larvae prior
      to the pupation, at the prepupa stage. The change of temperature from 25 to 31
      degrees during the second half of development in the 3rd instar affects the
      differentiation of imaginal discs. Some organs differentiate completely or
      partially (eyes, wings, legs) whereas the rest do not develop at all. The
      sensitive period embraces the whole larval development till the beginning of
      pupation.

      of direct and back crosses was shown to be due to the low fertilizability of
      eggs. A study of early embryogenesis, up to the gastrulation, has shown that the 
      F1 hybrids (female D. virilis x male D. littoralis) develop at a lesser rate than
      both the parental species. Some embryos of these latter attain the stage of
      blastoderm syncytium for 2 hrs whereas the hybrid embryos attain only the stage
      of polynuclear syncytium.

TI  - The characterization of multiple forms of kynurenine formidase in Drosophila
      melanogaster.
PG  - 468-77
AB  - Two enzymic forms of kynurenine formamidase (EC 3.5.1.9) from Drosophila
      melanogaster were separated and partially purified by pH fractionation, (NH4)
      2SO4 fractionation and Sephadex G-75 gel filtration. The enzymes were also
      separated by DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography and distinguished by
      their different rates of thermal inactivation. The multiple forms are termed
      formamidase I and formamidase II. The molecular weight of formamidase I as
      measured by Sephadex G-75 chromatography is 60 000 and that of formamidase II is 
      31 000. The pH optima are broad, ranging between 6.7 and 7.8 for formamidase I
      and 6.5 and 8.0 for formamidase II. The apparent Km values are 5-10(-3) and
      0.83-10(-3) M, resepctively. The possibility that formamidase II is an active
      subunit of formamidase I is discussed, although neither enzyme will convert to
      the other when separated and rechromatographed. Eight organisms were tested for
      the presence or absence of multiple forms of formamidase. Drosophila melanogaster
      and Drosophila virilis have both enzymes; cow, chicken, yeast and housefly have
      formamidase I only, and mouse and frog have formamidase II only.

PG  - 637-50
AB  - Heat denaturation studies of three different electrophoretic allozymes of octanol
      dehydrogenase were performed from 10 species of the Drosophila virilis group. A
      total of 18 alleles were discovered, and in 3 species in which electrophoretic
      studies indicated that the locus was monomorphic, heat denaturation showed that
      the locus was polymorphic. We show that electrophoretic studies underestimate the
      number of alleles at this locus by a factor of 2.6 in these species. The results 
      are discussed in the light of the continuing controversy over selection and
      neutral theories of genetic variation.

      populations, about 5740 chromosomes of Drosophila virilis flies from eight
      natural populations were analyzed by the null strain method for two linked
      esterase loci. The frequencies of these esterase genes appear to depend on

AB  - It was discovered that certain isoenzymes of esterases in Drosophila virilis are 
      represented by fast and slow subfractions. In various inbred lines, pecularities 
      are observed in the distribution of activity between these subfractions, so that 
      in adult individuals of some lines, the fast subfraction is the most active, and 
      in others the slow subfraction. During the process of ontogenesis, a
      redistribution of activity between the two subfractions is observed.

PG  - 87-94
AB  - The studies of genotype influence on puff size in salivary gland chromosomes of
      Drosophila virilis (stocks 9, 101, 142, 151) and D. texana (the stock 123) reveal
      significant differences between the species concerning the structure of puff in
      the 3-C-6 region at the stage of puparium formation. In reciprocal F1 hybrids the
      size of the puff was intermediate in comparison with parental forms having a
      slight maternal effect. The differences in puff size in the 5th chromosome
      between interspecific hybrids and the special stock of D. virilis carrying a
      region of D. texana 5th chromosome in heterozygous condition (inserted into D.
      virilis 5the chromosome by double crossing-over) were observed. The transfer of
      the region of the third chromosome to near centrimetric heterochromatic of the
      5th chromosome by translocation resulted in the increase in the 3-B-2 puff size. 
      However, the transposition of the 3-B1 region in the proximal direction with
      respect to chromocenter did not affect the puff size.

PG  - 263-8
AB  - The puff spectrum has been studied in the salivary gland chromosomes of D.
      virilis from 48 hrs of the 3rd larval until the gland lysis. 142 puffs were
      observed in the D. virilis genome. Among them, 43% were observed at all
      developmental stages and other puffs were unstable: 47.1% appear at a certain
      stage and degrade or remain until the gland lysis; 9.9% are characterized by the 
      "pulse" activity, i.e. they appear at a certain stage, degrade and reappear. The 
      number of newly appeared puffs exceeds that of fully degraded ones, i.e. the
      number of puffs during the gland development until its lysis increases
      constantly. At the stage of puparium formation, sexual differences in the puff
      length were found: puffs were longer in males than in females.

AB  - Satellite DNA amounts were examined in adult tissues of Drosophila virilis, a
      species whose DNA contains three prominent satellites. Satellite amounts in DNA
      from six of the seven tissues were lower than in DNA from diploid (adult brain)
      tissue. Satellite amounts in adult ovary DNA, however, were equivalent to or
      greater than diploid levels. When DNA from pupal ovaries was examined, a 30%
      increase in satellite amounts over diploid levels was found. An RNA-DNA
      hybridization experiment showed that the ribosomal RNA genes in pupal ovary DNA
      were under-replicated relative to diploid DNA levels.

AB  - The satellite DNAs of Drosophila virilis have been examined in diploid and
      polyploid tissues by isopycnic ultracentrifugation and thermal denaturation
      experiments. Previous work has established that the satellite DNAs are
      underreplicated in the polytene chromosomes of the salivary glands of D. virilis.
      The results of the present experiments demonstrate that this underreplication
      also takes place in the ovaries which contain nurse cells and follicle cells.
      These tissues are polyploid but do not show polytene chromosomes.

      differing in the electrophoretic mobility of certain esterases. Activity of the
      esterases was shown to persist at a low level during most of embryogenesis and to
      increase toward its end, especially after emergence. At the 16th-20th hour of
      embryonic development the maternal fractions are accompanied by the manifestation
      of paternal fractions of the slowly migrating esterase-4. Paternal forms of
      fast-migrating esterases (esterases-2 and -6) are found only after emergence in
      age I larvae.

TI  - A family of three related satellite DNAs in Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 2772-5
AB  - Isolated single DNA strands of satellites II or III of Drosophila virilis form
      hybrid duplexes with the complementary single strands of satellite I. The hybrids
      denature at a higher temperature than controls, renature rapidly, and form bands 
      of hybrid density in neutral CsCl. Isolated single strands of satellite II do not
      form clear-cut duplexes with the complementary strands of satellite III. Mixtures
      of satellites II and III denature at the same temperature as controls, and do not
      form bands in neutral CsCl. Therefore, satellite I-II and I-III complexes are
      extensively base paired, while satellite II-III complexes are minimally base
      paired. These experiments demonstrate partial homology among the three
      satellites, and suggest an evolutionary relationship among them. They also
      suggest that satellites and other repeated sequences from related species, which 
      do not form hybrids in vitro, could have a common evolutionary origin, but have
      accumulated enough base substitutions to lose interspecific homology demonstrable
      by hybrid duplex formation.

AB  - The effect of inbreeding on egg to adult viability was determined for Drosophila 
      virilis over a wide range of inbreeding levels (0 < F <.734). The quantity
      -log(e) (Viability) was found to be a curvilinear function of F, indicating
      synergistic interaction among loci. The curvature was not evident, however, below
      F =.500. The values of A and B (Mortonet al. 1956) were calculated to be.06
      and.77-.86, respectively. This extremely small value of A yielded a very large
      value for the B/A ratio i.e., 12.51-14.99.

TI  - The lamellar systems of cytoplasmic membranes in dividing spermatogenic cells by 
      Drosophila virilis.
PG  - 433-42
AB  - Spermatogenic cells of Drosophila virilis were studied by light and electron
      microscopy. The persistence of a "nuclear wall" during the meiotic divisions has 
      been reported by a number of early cytologists, but this interpretation has been 
      a subject of debate. Electron micrographs of dividing spermatocytes reveal the
      presence of multiple layers of paired membranes surrounding the nuclear region.
      These lamellar membrane systems are not typical of the nuclear envelope, but were
      interpreted as such by light microscopists. The membranes constituting a pair are
      separated by an interspace of approximately 100 A and successive pairs are 200 to
      400 A apart. These spacings are similar but not identical to those found in the
      lamellar systems of the Golgi complex. The cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum
      in this material are devoid of attached ribonucleoprotein particles, are more
      precisely ordered than in vertebrate cells, and show a uniform, narrow
      intracisternal space of approximately 100 A. The conspicuous asters appear to be 
      made up of similar paired membranes radiating from the centriolar region. The
      primary spermatocyte has numerous dictyosomes and a well developed endoplasmic
      reticulum in cisternal form, but no typical Golgi complex or endoplasmic
      reticulum is found during the meiotic division stages of metaphase to telophase. 
      Evidence is presented that these cytoplasmic organelles contribute to the
      formation of the extensive lamellar systems that appear during meiosis. The
      results of the Golgi silver staining methods and staining tests for
      phospholipids, basophilia, and the PAS reaction, indicate that the lamellar
      arrays of membranes present during meiosis are indistinguishable from the Golgi
      complex in their tinctorial properties.
